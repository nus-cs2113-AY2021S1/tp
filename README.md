# Quotesify

Quotesify is a free greenfield Java project by a team of software engineering students.

Are you constantly reading books and browsing articles on the web only to forget most of it in a short period of time?

If so Quotesify is for you! A minimal distraction free CLI that helps you manage the information you consume by tracking
the things you read and logging those important nuggets of wisdom you find along the way!

With Quotesify, users can add books and quotes that they wish to remember. They can categorize their books and quotes
by author, customized categories, and even rate their books. Quotesify also comes with a progress tracker just to
improve the reading experience of users.

and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open up your IDE (IntelliJ is highly recommended). If you are not at the welcome screen,
click `File` > `Close Project` to close any existing project.
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle:
    1. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
    2. Click `Newâ€¦` and find the directory where you saved your JDK.
4. Click `Import Project`.
5. Locate the *build.gradle* file and select it.
6. Click `OK`.
7. Click `Open as Project`.
8. Click `OK` to accept all default settings.
9. To verify the set up, locate the `Quotesify.java` file, right-click it and select `Run Quotesify.main()`.
If the setup is correct, you should see something like this as shown below:
