# Canteenhelper

During peak hours, people may not be able to know the dining situation and the density of the canteen they want to go to. To solve this problem, we want to create a program to store and display basic information of stalls in each canteen (e.g. Open hours, current menu, change order etc) to all their potential users. CanteenHelper is a command line (CLI) application that helps students, staff and even tourists order food in canteens efficiently. CanteenHelper will allow users to choose their favorite dishes from different stalls in different canteens based on the date and time provided by the users. They also can check the comments of the dishes and operating hours of the stalls and canteens.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11 (use the exact version), update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. **Configure Intellij for JDK 11**, as described [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html).
1. **Import the project _as a Gradle project_**, as described [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html).
1. **Verify the set up**: After the importing is complete, locate the `src/main/java/Logic.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Logic.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below:
