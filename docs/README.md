# ATHENA (Automated Timetable Helper Encourager n' Assistant)

ATHENA aims to help students automate the process of organising their schedule.
To start using ATHENA, you can set up ATHENA by entering your desired periods for work and rest. Then, at any time in the week, you can add tasks that need to be completed.
ATHENA will figure out the best timetable based on your available time slots.

ATHENA helps to reduce the amount of time and effort you need to spend planning your time by finding available periods in a day,
with the goal of reducing dead space in the your schedule.
Don't worry, ATHENA will make sure you have enough time to eat, exercise and sleep, while making sure that you can finish all your tasks on time.
