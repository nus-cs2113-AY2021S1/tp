# ra.VI

Hello! Thank you for choosing **ra.VI**.

**Repository Assistant with a Versatile Interface (ra.VI)** is a desktop app for managing tasks, deadlines, and notes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, **ra.VI** can manage your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.
