Welcome, and thank you for choosing **Zer0Note**!

**Zer0Note** is a note taking and organisation application meant for students (especially those who can type fast).
It combines the features of note-taking apps (like OneNote) with the interaction speed of command-line based tools like vim and emacs.
It helps students (like yourself!) to keep track of deadlines and take notes quickly.

**Zer0Note** is designed for students who love typing, and the command line!
