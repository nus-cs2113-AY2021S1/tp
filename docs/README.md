# PlaNUS

## Introduction

PlaNUS is a desktop application for NUS students to manage their tasks and schedule, 
optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI). We aim for PlaNUS to become a 
one stop location for students to be able to view all their commitments and assignments 
and prioritize their work and commitment with a user-friendly text interface.
