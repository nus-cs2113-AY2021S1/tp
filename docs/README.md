[[!CI status](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T14-4/tp/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T14-4/tp/actions)

DietBook is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application designed to **track your food and nutritional intake** as well as provide you with your **daily calorie recommendation**. As the application mainly targets _NUS students staying on campus_, it has a **database prepopulated with food items commonly found around NUS**. This allows for such food items to be easily added to the list of food items consumed for tracking.
