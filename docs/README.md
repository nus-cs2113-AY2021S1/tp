# KAJI

Have you ever spent hours and hours on end learning your Module content, only to forget it completely just a couple of months later when you are going to take your Finals? 
Are you tired of having to re-learn the entire Module from scratch again?

This process is actually completely normal and can be explained by "The Forgetting Curve", which says that when first learn something, information disappears at an exponential rate. Does having to re-learn content repeatedly annoy you? 
To combat "The Forgetting Curve", you can always implement study techniques like Spaced Repetition for yourself. But, the process is tiring and complicated.

Fret no more, as KAJI will do all the work for you, so that you can enjoy all the benefits of Spaced Repetition without you having to do any of the work!

KAJI is a schedule manager designed especially for University Students. KAJI implements Spaced Repetition, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). 
You can also store all your study materials on it, which means that you will always have your materials on hand when you need to revise them.
