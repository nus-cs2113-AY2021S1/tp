## 1. Introduction

E-Duke-8 (pronounced "Educate") helps CS2113/T students **learn and understand software engineering and [Object-oriented Programming (OOP)](#7-glossary) principles** through a gamified
platform and enhances their learning experience. 

It is a desktop application where CS2113/T students can attempt bite-sized quizzes, through the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#7-glossary), to test their understanding of the concepts taught, and serves to consolidate key concepts for easy revision.

On E-Duke-8, you can earn points for yourself as you attempt the quizzes! You can also view the statistics of your past quiz attempts to understand your current level of mastery of the various topics!

Challenge your friends to see who can earn the most points on E-Duke-8!

Understand more about E-Duke-8, and how you can use it to aid your learning, through this User Guide.

### 3.7. Starting a quiz: `quiz`

By following a specific input format for your command (shown below), you can start a quiz where the number of questions, topic and time limit to complete each question are specified by you.

While on a question, you can choose to answer it, ask for a hint (if you are unsure of the answer) or bookmark it for future reference!

You will have to complete the question within the specified time as well. If you are unable to complete it in time, it will be regarded as an incorrect answer and the correct answer, along with the explanation, will be shown to you. You will then be directed to start the next question where the timer will restart. 

A correct answer without requesting for a hint will earn you **2 points**! Whereas a correct answer with hint requested will earn you **1 point**. You will not be awarded any points for incorrect answers. You can view the points you have accumulated with the `stats` command, which will be further explained in a [later section](#312-displaying-stats-stats) of this guide.

Regardless of right or wrong answer, an explanation about the question will be displayed after you give an answer. You will then be directed to start the next question.

Note:
- The maximum time limit for each question that you can choose is 1000 seconds.
- Each of the questions in the quiz will be related to the topic you have chosen.

This is stored in the `user.json` file in the `data` folder and can be transferred between machines to keep your own
history. Please do not attempt to edit this file as it will disrupt the running of application (Refer to [**FAQ**](#4-faq) Q7).
If you want a better score you can always reattempt a quiz!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4. FAQ

**Q1**: Am I be able to re-attempt the same question after my quiz ends?

**A1**: Yes, you may. Questions for the quizzes are chosen randomly from all of the questions in a certain topic. Hence, there is a chance that the question you have attempted before gets chosen again if you choose to attempt another quiz from the same topic.

**Q2**: Why does my stats only improve as I do more quizzes? Shouldn't the penalities from my previous quizzes remain?

**A2**: E-Duke-8 tries to motivate you to understand CS2113/T concepts better. E-Duke-8 also encourages learning from failure. Therefore, you do not have to be disheartened by incorrect answers when attempting quizzes. Learn from the explanations given and get the question correct in your future quiz attempts to improve your stats!
A correct answer in a future quiz attempt would also mean that you have come to understand the concept being tested in the question, and hence, you should deserve the points for it.  

**Q3**: Why does my hint usage indicator for a question not disappear after I re-attempt the question without using hint?

**A3**: This is because the hint usage serves as an indicator that you might still have some doubts in the topic, and hence you might want to read more about it. Resetting the count for hint usage might take away this benefit. 

**Q4**: Using hints will limit the total points that I can earn to build up my stats, so why should I still use hint?

**A4**: While points you earn will indeed be lesser, you are still encouraged to use hints when you have any doubts while answering questions, as they help to spur your thinking, or to confirm your thoughts. 
Furthermore, hints might give you an alternative perspective to think about the question at hand, which may be helpful to how you answer similar questions in the future.

**Q5**: How are the points awarded for correct answers?

**A5**: A correct answer without requesting for a hint will earn you **2 points**, whereas a correct answer with hint requested will earn you **1 point**. You will not be awarded any points for incorrect answers.

**Q6**: How do I change the questions in the quizzes?

**A6**: You may download the sample `topics.json` from the [releases page](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-3/tp/releases).
Make sure to include this file in the `main` folder located in the `data` folder.
If these folders do not exist yet please run the application once to create it.

The directory structure should look something like this (assuming the main jar file is named `eduke8.jar` but this can be changed):

```
yourFolder
|   eduke8.jar
|
----data
    |
    ----main
    |   |   topics.json
    |   |   ...
    |
    ----logs
        |   ...
```

Your changes will not be reflected if the directory structure does not match that above.

Open `topics.json` in any text editor to edit the questions, make sure to follow the format of the questions
already provided. An example is shown below.

```json
[
  {
    "topic": "Topic Title", 
    "questions": [
      {
        "description": "What is your question?",
        "hint": "Put the hint here",
        "explanation": "Put the explanation here",
        "options": [ 
          {
            "description": "This is the first option and correct answer",
            "correct": true
          },
          {
            "description": "This is the second option",
            "correct": false
          },
          {
            "description": "This is the third option",
            "correct": false
          },
          {
            "description": "This is the fourth option",
            "correct": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Note:
- The title will be loaded with spaces replaced with underscores.
- There must be 4 options for each question.
- There must be one and only one option chosen as the correct answer by specifying `true` as the value of the
`correct` field. 
- If you edit the title of existing topics or description of existing questions then their associated user 
data might be erased.
- The title of a topic cannot be blank or repeated (not case-sensitive).
- If the title includes a backslash, you may not be able to use the title in anywhere of the program.
- The description of a question cannot be blank or repeated (not case-sensitive).
- If you want to re-attempt the same question, you can simply start a new quiz with the topic that the question is from.
- If you do not want to give a hint or explanation please provide an empty quotation marks, `""`, do not remove the key from the question.
- Make sure you follow the types of values used which is either a word/sentence enclosed with quotation marks, `""`, or a `true`/`false` value.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


**Q7**: What happens if I modify the user data in `user.json`?

**A7**: If you wish to modify the user data, the application may not be able to load it successfully. You will 
receive the following message, and the affected user data will be erased.

![user data error](./images/user_data_error.png)

Therefore, it is recommended that you do not modify the user data. Do build up your stats by attempting more quizzes! 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you have trouble starting the application there could be two sources of error for loading data.
It is possible that the data for `topics.json` or `user.json` has been tampered with wrongly and thus cannot be parsed
correctly. Please ensure that if you wish to edit the data in `topics.json`, such as to add questions, then you should follow the instructions found in [**FAQ**](#4-faq) Q6 carefully.

On the other hand, `user.json` should not be manually edited.
If you have accidentally changed this file, you may delete
the file to reset the data.
A new file will be created on start up.

If the above fixes do not work you may delete the `data` folder and use the default questions or 
download `topics.json` from the [releases page](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-3/tp/releases) again.
