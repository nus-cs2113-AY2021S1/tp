## 1. Introduction

During peak hours, people may not be able to know the dining situation and the density of the canteen they want to go to. To solve this problem, we want to create a program to store and display basic information of stalls in each canteen (e.g. Open hours, current menu, change order etc) to all their potential users. CanteenHelper is a command line (CLI) application that helps students, staff and even tourists order food in canteens efficiently. CanteenHelper will allow users to choose their favorite dishes from different stalls in different canteens based on the date and time provided by the users. They also can check the comments of the dishes and operating hours of the stalls and canteens.


## 2. Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
1. Down the latest version of `CanteenHelper` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-2/tp/releases/tag/v2.1).
