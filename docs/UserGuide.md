# DietBook User Guide

## Introduction
DietBook is a desktop application targeting NUS students living on campus, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface**. Not only can DietBook track and show the user's food and nutritional intake, it also provides users with a list of commonly eaten food items around and outside NUS.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your DietBook.
1. Either double-click the jar file to start the application or navigate to the folder containing the jar file on command prompt and run the command `java -jar dietbook.jar`. 
1. For first time users: <br/>

1. Refer to the [Features](##Features) section below for more details of each command.

## Features 

Notes about the command format:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.<br/> 
e.g. For `delete INDEX`, `delete 1` would be a valid command.
  
* Parameters in square brackets are optional. However, if all parameters are optional, at least one parameter needs to be given. In such cases, any one of the parameters would be valid.<br/>
e.g. For `add x/PORTION_SIZE n/FOOD_NAME k/CALORIE [c/CARBOHYDRATE] [p/PROTEIN] [f/FAT]`, `add x/1 n/Toast k/120`, `add x/1 n/Toast k/120 c/18`,  `add x/1 n/Toast k/120 c/18 p/3`, `add x/1 n/Toast k/120
 c/18 p/3 f/4` are all valid commands.
 
* For commands with multiple parameters, the parameters can be in any order.<br/>
e.g. For `add n/FOOD_NAME x/PORTION_SIZE`, `add n/mee x/1` and `add x/1 n/mee` are both valid.

* Command words and parameter indicators are case-sensitive.<br/>
e.g. `help` is a valid command but `Help` is not.<br/>
e.g. For `add n/FOOD_NAME x/PORTION_SIZE`, `add n/mee x/1` is valid but `add N/mee x/1` is not.

* A single spacing to separate command words, parameters, command word and parameters is required.<br/>
e.g. For `calculate all`, `calculate all` is valid but `calculateall` and `calculate` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `all` is not.<br/>
e.g. For `delete INDEX`, `delete 1` is valid if there is a food item with index 1 but`delete1` is not.<br/>
e.g. For `add n/FOOD_NAME x/PORTION_SIZE`, `add n/mee x/1` is valid but `add n/meex/1` is not.<br/>
