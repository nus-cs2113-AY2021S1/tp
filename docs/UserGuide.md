# DietBook User Guide

## Introduction
DietBook is a desktop application targeting NUS students living on campus, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface**. Not only can DietBook track and show the user's food and nutritional intake, it also provides users with a list of commonly eaten food items around and outside NUS.

## Features 

Notes about the command format:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.<br/> 
e.g. For `delete INDEX`, `delete 1`would be a valid command.
  
* Parameters in square brackets are optional. However, if all parameters are optional, at least one parameter needs to be given. In such cases, any one of the parameters would be valid.<br/>
e.g. For `add x/PORTION_SIZE n/FOOD_NAME k/CALORIE [c/CARBOHYDRATE] [p/PROTEIN] [f/FAT]`, `add x/1 n/Toast k/120`, `add x/1 n/Toast k/120 c/18`,  `add x/1 n/Toast k/120 c/18 p/3`, `add x/1 n/Toast k/120
 c/18 p/3 f/4` are all valid commands.
 
* For commands with multiple parameters, the parameters can be in any order.<br/>
e.g. For `add n/FOOD_NAME x/PORTION_SIZE`, `add n/mee x/1` and `add x/1 n/mee` are both valid.

* Command words and parameter indicators are case-sensitive.<br/>
e.g. `help` is a valid command but `Help` is not.<br/>
e.g. For `add n/FOOD_NAME x/PORTION_SIZE`, `add n/mee x/1` is valid but `add N/mee x/1` is not.

* Spaces to separate command words, parameters, command word and parameters are important.<br/>
e.g. For `calculate all`, `calculate all` is valid but `calculateall` is not.<br/>
e.g. For `delete INDEX`, `delete 1` is valid if there is a food item with index 1 but`delete1` is not.<br/>
e.g. For `add n/FOOD_NAME x/PORTION_SIZE`, `add n/mee x/1` is valid but `add n/meex/1` is not.<br/>
