SmartHomeBot is a **desktop application that consolidates all home applianceâ€™s control into a 
centralized system via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**. It is designed to assist disabled individuals with 
difficulties to perform tasks like switching On/Off Appliances at home.  Users can also 
review and monitor electricity usage; having a clearer picture of their electrical usage patterns.
SmartHomeBot has an auto-save feature that will automatically save all the appliances' data
and export it to a text file. Upon the start of the application, it will import the data 
from the text file and loads the appliances' data back.


##### Disclaimer: SmartHomeBot V2.1 does not interface with actual Appliances. Instead, Appliances are simulated in this program.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file 
that contains the data of your previous SmartHomeBot folder.

**Q**: Does the program interface with the appliance? 

**A**: Current SmartHomeBot v2.1 does not interface with actual Appliances. Instead the Appliances are simulated 
as a proof of concept for future implementation.
