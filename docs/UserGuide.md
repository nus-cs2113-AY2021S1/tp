# DietBook User Guide

## Introduction
DietBook is a desktop application, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI). It is designed to **track your food and nutritional intake** as well as provide you with your **daily calorie recommendation**. As the application mainly targets _NUS students staying on campus_, it has a **database prepopulated with food items commonly found around NUS**. This allows for such food items to be easily added to the list of food items consumed for tracking.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure that you have **Java 11** installed.
1. Download the latest version of `dietbook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T14-4/tp/releases).
1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your DietBook.
1. Navigate to the folder containing the jar file on command prompt and run the command `java -jar dietbook.jar`. 
1. Enable full-screen for a better experience but rest assure that DietBook will still function normally even in non full-screen mode.
1. For **first time users**: <br/>
A CLI, similar to the one shown below, should appear within a few seconds. Follow the instructions provided to setup DietBook or refer to [name](#entering-username-name) and [info](#entering-user-information-info) for more detailed explanations.<br/>
![DietBook Welcome Message](images/DietBookWelcomeMessage.PNG)  
1. Start using DietBook by typing any valid command and pressing Enter to execute it.
1. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for more details of each command or jump to [Command Summary](#command-summary) section for a list of valid commands.

## Features 

:warning: **Please take note of the following:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are **parameters to be supplied** by the user.<br/> 
e.g. For `name YOUR_NAME_OR_NICKNAME`, `name Jack` would be a valid command.
  
* Parameters in **square brackets are optional**. However, if all parameters are optional, **at least one parameter needs to be given**. In such cases, any one of the parameters would be valid.<br/>
e.g. For `editinfo [n/NAME] [g/GENDER] [a/AGE] [h/HEIGHT] [o/ORIGINAL_WEIGHT] [c/CURRENT_WEIGHT] [t/TARGET_WEIGHT] [f/FITNESS_LEVEL]`, `editinfo a/31` and `editinfo h/173 o/87` are valid commands but `editinfo` is not.
 
* For commands with multiple parameters, the parameters can be in any order **only if the parameters are attached to a parameter tag** like `n/`, `a/`, etc. Otherwise, they **must be entered in the sequence as shown** in this guide, the [Help Command](#to-view-a-list-of-valid-commands-help) or the [Summary Command](#command-summary).<br/>
e.g. For `calculate NUTRIENT_TYPE [yyyy-mm-ddTHH:mm] [yyyy-mm-ddTHH:mm]`,`calculate fat 2020-07-03T23:59 2020-09-03T23:59` is valid but `calculate 2020-07-03T23:59 fat 2020-09-03T23:59` is not.<br/>
e.g. For `add i/INDEX x/PORTION_SIZE [yyyy-mm-ddTHH:mm]`, `add x/1 i/1 2020-09-03T23:59` is valid but `add i/1 2020-09-03T23:59 x/1 ` is not as time needs to be entered as the last parameter. 

* Command words and parameter indicators are **case-sensitive**.<br/>
e.g. `help` is a valid command but `Help` is not.<br/>
e.g. For `add i/INDEX x/PORTION_SIZE [yyyy-mm-ddTHH:mm]`, `add i/1 x/1 2020-07-03T23:59` is valid but `add I/1 x/1 2020-07-03T23:59` is not.

* **Spacing** to separate command word and parameters is required.<br/> 
e.g. For `calculate NUTRIENT_TYPE`, `calculate all` is valid but `calculateall` is not.

* Inappropriate usage of `/`, the forward slash, may lead to invalid commands. Only use **one** `/` in parameter tags like `n/`, `a/`, etc and avoid using `/` otherwise.

### Features related to nutritional intake calculation

#### Calculating nutrition intake: calculate
Calculate the amount of nutrition in the foods in intake list.

Format: `calculate NUTRITION_NAME [START_TIME] [END_TIME]`
* The NUTRITION_NAME should be one of the five cases, which are: `calorie`, `carbohydrate`, `protein`, `fat`, and `all`.
    * `calorie`: calculate the total amount of calorie from the foods in the intake list.
    * `carbohydrate`: calculate the total amount of carbohydrate from the foods in the intake list.
    * `protein`: calculate the total amount of protein from the foods in the intake list.
    * `fat`: calculate the total amount of fat from the foods in the intake list.
    * `all`: calculate the total amount of all five nutrition elements.
* Although two time inputs are listed as optional, the END_TIME is only meaningful inputted with the START_TIME.
    * `calculate NUTRITION_NAME`: calculate the amount of nutrition from all foods in the intake list.
    * `calculate NUTRITION_NAME [START_TIME]`: calculate the amount of nutrition from the foods after a time in the intake list.

    * output: `Got it! I've added this food item:
                 Salty Chicken Rice | calorie : 300 |  protein : - |  carbohydrate : - |  fats : - -- (1)`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Either download `dietbook.jar` on the other computer and overwrite the empty data files with the data files from your previous computer or copy the whole DietBook home folder from the previous computer to the new computer.
data from v2.1 is **NOT** compatible with earlier data. The data is found in `C/Users/{User name}/dietbook`. As of v2.1 the food list data is found in the folder
