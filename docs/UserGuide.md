## 4. Features 

This section will show the features of our program in detail.
You can follow along as we go through each of the features if you are starting out, or skip ahead to the Command Summary
to see the commands of all features at a glance.

#### Command Format 

Words in UPPER CASE are the parameters to be supplied by user.
> :information_source: Our program also supports shorthand commands.  You can use shorthand command format for faster access. Instead of typing the word in its entirety, you can use the shorthand replacement instead.
For example, as shown in the picture below, instead of typing `event`, you can type just the letter `e`. Both serve the same functionality.

OR `import FILENAME /c hr /name HEADER_NAME /phone HEADER_NAME /email HEADER_NAME /role HEADER_NAME`  
OR `import FILENAME /c event /name HEADER_NAME /date HEADER_NAME /time HEADER_NAME`

This command allows you to specify which columns of your CSV file you would like to copy over to the program.  

Example: Let's say you have a CSV file like shown below, and you would like to import it.    
![CSV File](userGuidePic/import1.png)  
In our example, the CSV file we are importing is in the same directory as CCA Manager.  
![Location of File](userGuidePic/import2.png)  
You can use the command `import sample.csv /c hr /name Member /phone Contact /email Email /role Role` to import the document.  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The expected outcome is as follows:
