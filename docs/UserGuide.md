![delete_additional_info_command](images/delete_additional_info_command.PNG)

Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output will differ if you have a different event 
or different additional information stored in the event index number 1.
 
### Marking a task as done:

To help manage your tasks better, you can mark a task on your calendar list as completed by using the `done` command.

 for you to use this feature frequently to keep your task and event lists uncluttered!

Format: `-t <task_number>`

Example:
 
 `-t 1` 
 
After executing this command, notice that task number 1 has been removed from your calendar.
 
 ![delete_task_command](images/delete_task_command.PNG)
 
 
 Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output will
 differ if you have a different task stored in the task index number 1.

#### Deleting an event:

### Finding a calendar item:

If you have a long list of calendar items, you may use this feature to find a calendar item based on a specific
keyword of the item’s description. Additionally, for a more specific search, you may search based on whether
it is a task or an event. 

#### Finding an item from the calendar list:

You can search the entire calendar based on a keyword. For example, you might want to search for the due date of an
assignment in your calendar.

Format: `/f <keyword>`

Example: 

`/f assignment` 

This displays a list of items (both tasks and events) containing the keyword “assignment”.

![find_item_command](images/find_item_command.PNG)

Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output depends on the items stored in the application.

Note: The items printed by the find functions are in the order of how the user added them, this is to facilitate other commands 
such as deleting the item.

![tip_find](images/tip_find.PNG)

#### Finding an item from the task list: 

You can also search from your task list based on a keyword. This will be useful if you need to narrow your search to
just your list of tasks instead of both tasks and events. For example, if you are just searching for your tuition
homework tasks, you can use this feature to exclude any events with description containing “tuition”!

Format: `/ft <keyword>`

Example: 

`/ft tuition` 

This displays a list of tasks containing the keyword “tuition”.

![find_task_command](images/find_task_command.PNG)


Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output depends on the tasks stored in the application.

#### Finding an item from the event list: 

Likewise, you can also search your event list based on a keyword. This is especially useful if you have multiple
tasks and events having a similar description. For example, if you are looking for events happening on the same date
, you can use this feature to exclude all deadline tasks with the same date!

Format: `/fe <keyword>`

Example: 

`/fe 09-Nov-2020`

This displays the list of events containing the keyword “09-Nov-2020”.

![find_event_command](images/find_event_command.PNG)

Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output depends on the events stored in the application.


![tip_find_event](images/tip_find_event.PNG)

### Prioritizing a task:                                                                                                

When you have important tasks, you can prioritize them in the task list to distinguish from ordinary tasks.
If you want to prioritize an important task, you can use `*t <task_number>` to mark the task as important. 
    
Format: `*t <task_number>`
    
Example: 

`*t 1` 

This marks the first task in the task list as important.

![prioritizing_command](images/prioritizing_command.PNG)

 Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output will
 differ if you have a different task stored in the task index number 1.

![warning_prioritizing](images/warning_prioritizing.PNG)

### Printing tasks:

If you want to prioritize or delete some of the tasks on hand but cannot recall the task number as there are simply 
too many tasks, you can always ask _**25HoursADay**_ to print out all tasks saved in the application. 
In this way, you can have a better picture of the tasks on hand! 

Format: `print tasks`

Example:

`print tasks`

This prints all tasks stored in the application.

![printTasks](images/printTasks_command.png)

Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output will
differ if you have different tasks stored in the calendar list.

Note: The events are printed in the order of how the user added them, this is to facilitate other commands such as marking a
task as done or deleting a task.

![tips_printtask](images/tip_printTasks.PNG)

### Printing events:

If you want to delete past events or to add additional information to a certain event, you can always ask the application 
to display all events saved in the application. This feature will definitely save your brain space wasted on memorising them.

Format: `print events`

Example:

`print events`

This prints all events stored in the application.

![printEvents](images/printEvents_command.png)

Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output will
differ if you have different events stored in the calendar list.

Note: The events are printed in the order of how the user added them, this is to facilitate other commands such as adding 
additional information for an event or deleting an event.

![tips_printevents](images/tip_printEvents.PNG)

### Printing important tasks:
    
If you just want to view all the important tasks instead of all the tasks in the calendar list now, 
you can type `print *` command to view the list of important tasks together with their information.                           
                                                    
Format: `print *`

Example:

`print *`

This prints all important tasks in the application.

![print*](images/printImportant_command..PNG)

Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output will
differ if you have different tasks stored in the calendar list.

### Printing progress: 

If you have a lot of tasks and want to trace the progress of how many of the tasks have been finished, 
you can type  `print progress` command to see the fraction and percentage proportion of the finished tasks among all the tasks.

Format: `print progress`

Example:

`print progress`

This displays your current progress.

![print_progress](images/printProgress_command.PNG)

Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output will
differ if you have completed different number of tasks.

### Giving suggestion: 

When you have a lot of tasks and do not know preparing for which several tasks first, you can get some simple suggestions from the 25HoursADay. 
This application can select several important and urgent tasks in the task list for you. If you want to view the suggestions, 
you can type the `suggestion` command to see the recommended tasks together with their information.  
    
Format: `suggestion`

Example:

`suggestion`

This prints the more urgent items for you.

![suggestion_command](images/suggestion_command.PNG)

Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output will
differ if you have different items stored in the calendar list.

### Printing timeline

If you want to see your calendar items in a timeline format, you can always use the personalised calendar feature. 
There are four kinds of personalised calendar that you can print: default calendar, weekly calendar, monthly calendar, 
and calendar before a specific date you choose.
