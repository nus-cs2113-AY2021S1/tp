## Introduction

NUSchedule is a straightforward yet sophisticated application that helps you manage your events. It allows you 
 to keep track of not only your school events or activities (eg. lectures, tutorials, assignments), but 
also your personal activities. It utilises a command line interface (CLI), which accepts user input in the form of text. 
This gives the application both simplicity and speed, setting it apart from other apps such as NUSMods and Luminus.

### View available commands - Wu Nan

Shows list of commands and provides a link to the user guide for more details. 

Format: `help`


### Add an event - Brendan

Adds events/tasks to the schedule. Can support various types of tasks:  

* PersonalEvent  
  Format:  
  `personalEvent EVENTNAME /t DATE TIME /e DATE TIME /l LOCATION` for offline events.  
  OR  
  `personalEvent EVENTNAME /t DATE TIME /e DATE TIME /o MEETING_LINK /p MEETING_PASSWORD` for online events.  
    
  Note that `/e DATE TIME` is optional. You may input a personal event without an ending time.  
  In `/e DATE TIME`, `DATE` is optional. If you enter `/e TIME`, the default date will be the same 
  as the date that the event starts.  
  For online events, `/p MEETING_PASSWORD` is optional, since not all online events require a password.

* Assignment  
  Format:  
  `assignment EVENTNAME /t DATE TIME /l LOCATION`  
  OR  
  `assignment EVENTNAME /t DATE TIME /o SUBMISSION_LINK`  

* Class  
  Format:  
  `class CLASSNAME /t DATE TIME /e DATE TIME /l LOCATION`  
  OR  
  `class CLASSNAME /t DATE TIME /e DATE TIME /o MEETING_LINK /p MEETING_PASSWORD`  
    
  Similar to personal events, in `/e DATE TIME`, `DATE` is optional. For online events,`/p MEETING_PASSWORD` is optional.  
  However, `/e DATE TIME` or `/e TIME` is required, since all classes should have an ending time. 

* SelfStudy
  Format:
   `selfStudy EVENTNAME /t DATE TIME /e DATE TIME /l LOCATION` for offline events.  
    OR  
    `selfStudy EVENTNAME /t DATE TIME /e DATE TIME /o MEETING_LINK /p MEETING_PASSWORD` for online events.  
      
    Note that `/e DATE TIME` is optional. You may input a personal event without an ending time.  
    In `/e DATE TIME`, `DATE` is optional. If you enter `/e TIME`, the default date will be the same 
    as the date that the event starts.  
    For online events, `/p MEETING_PASSWORD` is optional, since not all online events require a password.  
    
Examples of usage: 
  
`class CS2113 Lecture /t 2020-09-23 10:00 /e 12:00 /l LT27`
`personalEvent Momâ€™s Birthday /t 2020-10-26 19:00 /l home`
`assignment CS1010 Assignment /t 2020-01-04 23:59 /o Luminus`

### Edit an event - Xu Che
The `edit` command allows you to edit the event type, description, start/end date and location for an existing 
event. You can start using this command by entering `edit INDEX`, where INDEX is the number of the task you want to
edit. 

Format: `edit INDEX`  

Example:  

Let's say you have one event stored in NuSchedule currently:  

![edit1](diagrams/edit1.png)
  
Suppose you entered the timing incorrectly and would like to edit it to the correct timing. Enter the following command
to edit the event:  

![edit2](diagrams/edit2.png) 

Next, you will be prompted to enter the new values for the 5 fields which are type, description, location start and end 
date respectively. Enter your desired changes and press the `ENTER` key to go through the fields. You can leave a field 
blank and simply press enter if you do not want to make any changes.

Expected Outcome:  
![edit4](diagrams/edit4.png)

![edit5](diagrams/edit5.png)


### Sort events - Xu Che
With this command, you can sort all events by either their end time, location or their description. When sorting by time, events
will be sorted in a chronological order. Events with an earlier end date will be sorted on top of events with later end
dates. This way, you can prioritize the events that are due soon.   

When sorting by description, the events will be sorted in alphabetical order according to their descriptions. Events 
with descriptions starting with 'a' will be sorted on top of events with descriptions starting with 'z' for example.  

When sorting by location, the events will be sorted in alphabetical order according to their location. Events with
offline locations will be sorted on top of locations with online locations.  

Format: `sort SORT_CRITERIA`  

Example: `sort description`

Before sorting:

After sorting:

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains 
the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: What if I cannot run the application, or the application suddenly stops running unexpectedly?

**A**: If you cannot run the application at the beginning, please refer back to the Quick Start section and check
whether the jar file is in the correct folder. If you cannot find what is wrong, please take a screenshot of your computer
and report it as an issue to [this link](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F14-4/tp/issues).

**Q**: What should I do if I cannot get the input format for adding events correctly?

**A**: For all wrong input format, there will be an error message to tell you what exactly you have input wrongly. If
the error message is not helpful, please refer back to relevant sections in Features. We recommend you to follow the 
instructions provided closely as the current version of NUSchedule has a relatively high requirement in terms of input 
accuracy. If you really cannot find what is wrong, please report it as an issue to [this link](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F14-4/tp/issues).
