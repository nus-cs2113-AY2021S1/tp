<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>  

# Manual Tracker
Users can manage lists of entries, which are known as ledgers. Each list represents a single date of record.

> Example
    If I wish to record my income and expenditures on 30 October 2020, I will use the program as follows:
    1. Use Manual Tracker to create a ledger of date 20-10-03
    2. Open the ledger of date 20-10-03 
    3. Use Entry Tracker to create entries to record the transactions for that particular date

## Add ledger
Add a ledger to the record, representing a date.

>Syntax

    new {PARAM_TYPE} {PARAM} 
    
Param Type| Param | Param Format
----------|-------|------------|
`/date`|Date of the ledger, and all the entries under that ledger.| Input string of the date in YYMMDD, YY-MM-DD or YY-M-D

> Example: 

![](developerGuide_images/screenshots_manualtracker/manual_new.png)
    
## Remove ledger
Remove a specified ledger from the record, referenced by date or id on the list.
This means that the user only need to specify one of the two param types, either ```/date``` or ```/id```.

>Syntax
 
    delete {PARAM_TYPE} {PARAM}
    
Param Type| Param | Param Format
----------|-------|------------|
`/date`|Date of the ledger, and all the entries under that ledger.| Input string of the date in YYMMDD, YY-MM-DD or YY-M-D
`/id`|Index of the ledger in the list, where the first ledger is of index 1. | Input positive integer 

> Example: 

![](developerGuide_images/screenshots_manualtracker/manual_delete1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
    
## Open ledger
Users will gain access into the entries associated with the specified ledger, referenced by date or id on the list.
This means that the user only need to specify one of the two param types, either ```/date``` or ```/id```.

* Automatic creation of non-existing ledgers 
    * If the ledger specified do not exist and if the param type supplied is "/date", the program will create a new ledger
    in accordance to the date supplied.
    * If the user specifies a non-existing index, then the program will not have enough information to create the new ledger instance. Automatic creation
    will not apply in this particular case.
    
Refer to Feature Entry Tracker onwards for further instructions.

>Syntax

    open {PARAM_TYPE} {PARAM}


Param Type| Param | Param Format
----------|-------|------------|
`/date`|Date of the ledger, and all the entries under that ledger.| Input string of the date in YYMMDD, YY-MM-DD or YY-M-D
`/id`|Index of the ledger in the list, where the first ledger is of index 1. | Input positive integer 

> Example: 

![](developerGuide_images/screenshots_manualtracker/manual_open.png)

# Entry Tracker
Subroutine that is subsidiary off the ManualTracker. 
Users can manage entries associated with the ledger they have opened.
Entries are specified by the following parameters:

* Time of transaction
   * Time in which the transaction ocurred
* Type of transaction 
   * Income or Expense
* Category of transaction. The user is only limited to the following set of categories. 
   * Income: {Salary, Allowance, Others}
   * Expense: {Transport, Food, Travel, Shopping, Bills, Others}
* Amount
   * Amount involved in the transaction. 
      * If the transaction type is expense, the amount is considered as a deduction to the account.
      * If the transaction type is income, the amount is considered as a credit to the account.
* Description
   * User input texts to help them record the details of the transaction.

> Example

    Ledger of date 20-10-03
        Entry 1: Shopping at MBS : $1500
        Entry 2: Salary : $3000
    
    From the above, we can infer that on the date 20-10-03, the user has one expense entry and one income entry.
    
## Add entry
Add an entry to the ledger record.

__Note:__
* For transaction categories, we require the users to enter the shortcut equivalent to the categories listed above. Refer to the following table.

Category|Category shortcut|Compatible transaction type
----------|-------|------------|
FOOD|fd|Expense
BILLS|bll|Expense
TRANSPORT|tpt|Expense
TRAVEL|tvl|Expense
SALARY|slr|Expense
ALLOWANCE|alw|Income
OTHERS|oth|Income

>Syntax

    new {PARAM_TYPE} {PARAM}

        
Param Type| Param | Param Format
----------|-------|------------|
`/time`|Time of the entry.| Input string of the date in HHMM, HHMMSS or H.
`/amt`|Amount involved in the transaction.| Input positive floating point number in 2 d.p. <br/> Can be $XX.XX, XX, etc.
`/cat`|Category of transaction. | Input string belonging in the set: {tpt, fd, tvl, shp, bll, slr, alw}
`-i or -e`|Type of transaction. | No parameter required. 
`/desc`|Information about the transaction | Description should not have ';' characters.<br/>Users can use the '>' character to indent their input texts. 

> Example: 

![](developerGuide_images/screenshots_entrytracker/entry_create.png)

> Note that ';' is an illegal input character! Also, you can force indent to your text using '>' key. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Edit entry
Edit an existing entry in the ledger record.
Users only need specify the param-type to edit; there is no need to fill out all param-types as per the create entry command.

__Note__
* While the index is compulsory to be provided, the rest of the params are not compulsory.
The users will include the params that they wish to modify.
* Hence, a sample command ```entry edit /id 1 /time 1600``` will modify entry at __index 1__ to __time 1600__.

>Syntax

    edit /id {INDEX} {PARAM_TYPE} {PARAM} ... 
        
Param Type| Param | Param Format
----------|-------|------------|
`/id`|Index of the entry in the list, where the first entry is of index 1. | Input positive integer
`/time`|Time of the entry.| Input string of the date in HHMM, HHMMSS or H.
`/amt`|Amount involved in the transaction.| Input positive floating point number in 2 d.p. <br/> Can be $XX.XX, XX, etc.

# Recurring Tracker
Users can manage expenses/income that recurs on a monthly basis e.g. monthly bill or salary.

## New entry
Creates a recurring entry. Entries can either be income or expense. If income, entries
can be set to "auto" which indicates that the income is automatically credited to the user's
bank account e.g. Salary which is transferred into bank account by company. 
Else, it will indicate a manually credited income, which requires the user to 
collect or take action upon e.g. collecting payment from customers (as a supplier), redeeming
of reward points on a monthly basis.

Vice versa for expense entries.

**Parameters** <br />
* `-e` OR `-i` - Indicates whether entry is income or expense (Mandatory to have 1 of 2, but not both)

    //Netflix, $40 per month, auto-payment via credit card 
    on the 10th of every month. Saved with a note of “Cancel if Homemade ends"
    
    new -i /desc Redeem air miles for vouchers /amt 50 /day 12
    //Redeem air miles for vouchers, $50 per month, user has to take manual action 
    by 12th of every month.

**Parameters** <br />
* `/id` - Index of item to be deleted. 1-based indexing (Mandatory)

>Example

**Parameters** <br />

the following reminders will be shown upon launching the program or returning to main menu.
