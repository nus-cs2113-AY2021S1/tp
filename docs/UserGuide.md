## 4.0 Quick Start  
  
1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.  
2. You can download the latest version of `Zoomaster` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W11-1/tp/releases)
 if you are running a older version.
3. Now move the **zoomaster.jar** file into your desired home folder for Zoomaster. <br/><br/> 
4. Copy the absolute path of your **zoomaster.jar** file by first highlighting your file, then while
holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key on your keyboard, right click on that file and select the option "Copy as path". 
<br/><br/> 
5. Afterwards, start Command Prompt by pressing <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> on the keyboard, 
then type in "cmd" and hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. <br/><br/> 
6. In the Command Prompt, type in "java -jar", then paste the absolute path you copied previously in step 4. 
It should look similar to the picture below:  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Speedweener/ip/master/docs/images/zoomastercommand.png) <br/><br/> 
7. Finally, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You should should see something similar to this Zoomaster logo indicating 
that you have successfully started your Zoomaster program. <br/><br/> 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Speedweener/ip/master/docs/images/zoomastercommandline.PNG)

8. The app is now ready to go! Go ahead and test it out with a `help` command. 
The app should print out a list of different commands. <br/><br/> 

9. You can now refer to the section below to explore the different features of the Zoomaster app.
  
## 5.0 Features   

This section will explain to you the different features of Zoomaster and how you can interact with it. 
<!-- @@author fchensan -->
Zoomaster has three different modes:
* **Bookmark mode**
    In this mode, Zoomaster stores all of your bookmarks that are not related to any modules.
* **Timetable mode**
    Here, you can create a timetable of all of your classes, and assign a bookmark or Zoom link on each of the time slots.
* **Planner mode**
    Have you ever had diffulties deciding when to have a meeting as all of your groupmates have different classes? In Planner mode, Zoomaster can help you find common free timings by allowing you to import your teammates' timetables.

Each mode has its own different sets of features and commands, which will be explained in sections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.

### 5.1 Global Commands

These commands can be used by you in every mode of the app.


<a name="help"></a>  
#### 5.1.1 Show help information: `help` (Yu Shing + Zhan Hao)
You can see the list of commands available in mode you are currently in.
```
Format: help {COMMAND(optional)}
```
>Let's say you require help to see the commands you can access the main menu mode. 
>You will first enter `help` into the console.
>

<a name="mode"></a>  
#### 5.1.2 Switch mode: `mode` (Yu Shing)
You can switch between “bookmark”, “timetable” and "planner" modes. Depending on the mode you select the behaviour of the commands below changes. <br/><br/> 

There are three modes for Zoomaster, Bookmark, Timetable and Planner modes.

```
Format: mode {bookmark/timetable/planner}
```

Example of usage:   
* `mode bookmark`
* `mode timetable` 
* `mode planner`

>Here is an example of switching from the main menu of Zoomaster to the bookmark modes. <br/><br/>

<a name="clear"></a>  
#### 5.1.3 Clear screen: `clear` (Zhan Hao)
You can clear the command prompt screen using this command. 
It is useful when your screen gets cluttered with prior commands. For example, when you have added a whole bunch
of modules and timeslots to your timetable. Then you can use `clear` command to remove those commands. <br></br>
Note that if your monitor screen has high dimensions, you might need multiple calls of this command to fully
clear your screen.
```
Format: clear
```

#### 5.1.4 Launch bookmarks of current lesson: `launch now` (Xing Rong)
You can launch the bookmarks of a current lesson slot in your timetable. 
The time depends on the system time of your machine with an additional 5 minutes of buffer, 
allowing you to launch your zoom session ahead of time.
  
```
Format: launch now    
```

>Here is an example of launching the bookmark of the current lesson. In this case, the URL attached to the slot
>is www.google.com. <br/><br/> 
>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W11-1/tp/master/docs/images/launchnow.png) <br/><br/> 

You should expect to see the urls of the current or 5 minutes advance lesson slot launching
in your native browser. Otherwise, you should see the message `no lesson now`.

<a name="showsettings"></a>  
#### 5.1.5. Show settings: `showsettings` (Francisco)
Once you are comfortable using Zoomaster, this command, along with the `set` command, helps you customise Zoomaster's behaviour.
```
Format: showsettings
```
When you type in this command, you will see two settings that you can adjust: <br></br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fchensan/tp/docs-images/docs/images/showsettings.png) <br></br>
The two settings are:
* Default mode on start-up.
    You can choose between `mainmenu`, `timetable`, or `bookmark` as the first mode you will enter when you start Zoomaster.
* Autosave.
    By default, this is turned on and Zoomaster will save files every time you make changes. You might want to turn this off if you prefer to save only when you exit. 

<br/><br/> 
<a name="setsetting"></a>  
#### 5.1.6. Set a setting: `set {SETTING_NAME} {NEW_OPTION}` (Francisco)
While `showsettings` shows you the settings, this command lets you change one of the settings.
* `{SETTING_NAME}` is the name of the setting as shown when you type in the `showsettings` command.
* `{NEW_OPTION}` is the new setting option that you would like to select. This needs to be typed in exactly as show from the `showsettings` command.

For example, let's say that you want Zoomaster to enter `bookmark` mode when you start it. 
You can type in `set def_mode bookmark` and Zoomaster will change your settings, as shown below.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fchensan/tp/docs-images/docs/images/setsettings.png)

The next time you run Zoomaster, you will automatically enter bookmark mode.

Format (chaining commands): add {MODULE} {DESCRIPTION} {DAY} {START_TIME} {END_TIME} {URL}, {DESCRIPTION} {URL}, ...
```  

* Multiple bookmarks can be added to a module and a slot.
  * To add another bookmark to an existing module, you have to enter the module code of the 
    existing module in the timetable. 
  * To add another bookmark to an existing slot, you can enter the command with the matching details 
    of the existing slot or use the index number of the slot in the module to access the slot. 
    Index number of the slot can be found by using the command `show {MODULE}`. 
* Each command works by checking if each of the components (module, slot, bookmark) 
  exists or is valid from left to right of the input before adding them.
  * In the command `add cs2113t lecture fri 16:00 18:00`, if `cs2113t` module already exists, 
    then it will not be added into the timetable. The slot `lecture fri 16:00 18:00` 
    will then be added to the existing `cs2113t` module.

## 6.0 FAQ  

**Q**: My Zoomaster logo looks weird! Is there something wrong with my program?   

  
**A**: Some users might encounter a start-up screen that looks like this. <br></br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W11-1/tp/master/docs/images/buglogo.png)

This is only a visual bug. Other than the weird looking logo, Zoomaster will work as per normal. No
need to worry!
<br/><br/> 

  
**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?   
  
**A**: Simply copy the `data/bookmarks.txt` and `data/slots.txt` file to the **data** directory. This directory should be
 in the same location where you have stored the `jar` file. <br></br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Speedweener/ip/master/docs/images/directory.png)

Start the application and all the data should be loaded.
<br/><br/> 

**Q**: Can I add a module not from NUS?   
  
**A**: Yes you can! <br> In the **data** directory locate the  `modulelist.txt` file. Add the new module on a new line
and save the txt file. You can now add the module in Zoomaster.
