## What is PlaNUS
PlaNUS is a desktop application for NUS students to manage their tasks and schedule.
With this system, you can add your upcoming tasks into the list, and then display
them in a table view or in a calendar view, so that you may easily see and plan your
schedule ahead. This application is optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI),
this means that you operate the application by typing commands into the command box.

This is what **PlaNUS** looks like:

## Features 


### Notes about command format:
```
- Words in UPPER_CASE are the inputs to be supplied by the user while words in LOWER_CASE are the command words.
    - e.g. in "add DESCRIPTION [d/DATE] [st/START_TIME] [et/END_TIME] [p/PRIORITY]", 
    add is a command word while DESCRIPTION is a description about the task.
      
- Parameter in square bracket is optional. 
    - e.g. in "add DESCRIPTION [d/DATE] [st/START_TIME] [et/END_TIME] [p/PRIORITY]", 
    DATE, START_TIME, END_TIME and PRIORITY are optional inputs which can be omitted.
    
- Input date format is dd-MM-yyyy.
    - e.g. 20-02-2020 means 20th February 2020
      
- Input time format is HHmm in 24-hrs.
    - e.g. 1830 means 6.30pm
    
- Input priority format is 1, 2 or 3 which represents LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH respectively.
    - e.g. 1

- Task index is the number displayed between "#" and description of the task.
    - e.g. "#1029 meeting", 1029 is the index.

- Input reminder format is either on or off, with the time component having the same HHmm in 24-hrs.

- If only the index is entered for the edit command, command will still be valid.
    - e.g. "edit 1028' is valid. 
```

### Displaying tasks : `list` 

Default/no suffix: display **all** tasks in the **order of their addition**.  
`-d`: display **all** tasks by **date**, from oldest to newest.  
`-p`: display **all** tasks by **priority**, from HIGH to LOW.  
`-w`: display **only tasks in current week** in a weekly view.

`d/DATE`: display **all tasks under a specified date** in **order of their addition**.

Regarding the format, '|' means "or", thus the suffix can either be `-d`, `-p`, `-w`, `-m`, or `d/DATE`.
It can also be nothing since square brackets denote optional.  
Under partial display modes like daily, weekly and monthly view, 
you could enter `q`, `w` and `e` to quit, view previous and next period respectively.

`list`  
`list -d`  
`list -w`
