## 1. Overview
This section gives an overview about KAJI and the purpose of this user guide.

### 1.1. About KAJI
In your past learning experience, have you encountered these problems? A large number of lecture notes and materials have made your computer desktop messy, 
and there is no way to find the materials you want. When the exam is approaching, you don’t know which subject to review first, or suddenly find that you have 
forgotten everything you learned before. No one wants to forget what they have dedicated time to learn.

Don't worry! <strong>KAJI</strong> will help you solve all these problems!

Kaji is a schedule manager that implements Spaced Repetition, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### 1.2. About this User Guide
This User Guide explains how to use KAJI. It provides an understanding of the features and commands, as well as some common use cases of this application.

In this guide, we cover:
* How to use the Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Syntax of the commands available in different levels in KAJI
* Common use cases for each command
* Summary of all the commands


### 1.3. Understanding the Command Line Interface (CLI)
To use KAJI, you have to first know the Command Line Interface, the platform that KAJI runs on. However, as we have simplified the interface for you, here is a simplified introduction that will cover everything you need to know about the CLI to use KAJI.

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/CLI.png" width="600" alt="CLI"/>
  <br/>Figure 1. KAJI CLI Layout 
</p>

* <b>Command Prompt:</b> This is where you enter your commands
* <b>Access Level:</b> This displays the access level that you are currently at
* <b>Result Display:</b> This displays feedback and other useful information about your commands that you have just entered

### 1.4. Understanding KAJI

#### 1.4.1. Content Management
KAJI's content management system is similar to a physical folder which you may use to organize your lecture handouts. <br>
KAJI manages content in four different levels, they are the Admin Level, the Module Level, the Chapter Level and the Flashcard Level:

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/contentManagement.png" width="600" alt="Content Management"/>
  <br/>Figure 2. Content Management Diagram
</p>

* **Admin Level** is like your **bookshelf** to keep all the separated module folder in place.
* **Module Level** is like a **folder** to keep all your lecture notes and materials by different module codes.
* **Chapter level** is like an **index sticker** which organizes different pieces of information into its relevant chapters.
* **Flashcard level** is all the **primary notes and material** which you have collected for your modules. With KAJI's assistant, you can easily categorise your messy notes into organized structure.

When you start our program, you begin on the **Admin Level**, indicated by the prompt "admin" as shown here. <br>
To add/modify/remove elements of a certain level, you have to be on the level above it. <br>
* E.g. to create a new Module in the **Module Level**, you have to be on the **Admin Level**
* E.g. to create a new Flashcard in the **Flashcards Level**, you have to be on the **Chapter Level**

Refer to [Features](#3-features) below for details of each command.

#### 1.4.2. Schedule Management
Your biggest reason to use KAJI lies in KAJI's ability to provide you with the full benefits of "Spaced Repetition" without you having to do the tedious manual work involved. To accomplish this, KAJI comes with an automated Schedule Management feature that will facilitate the "Spaced Repetition" scheduling process for you. 

To find out more about how you can utilise the feature and even customise it to your liking, find out more [below](#45-scheduling-in-kaji).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3. Features
This section introduces the syntax and usages of the commands for the features available in KAJI. 
In explaining the syntax, do take note of the following command format which applies to all KAJI commands:
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that you need to provide.
    * <b>Example:</b> In `add MODULE_NAME`, `MODULE_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add CS2113`.
* Parameters cannot be given in any order.
    * <b>Example:</b> In `edit MODULE_INDEX MODULE_NAME`, entering `edit CS2113 1` will result in an error as 
      the `MODULE_INDEX` and `MODULE_NAME` parameters are in the wrong order.
* The `INDEX` that is used for various commands is a number used to identify a module/chapter/flashcard within the list.
The `INDEX` of a module/chapter/flashcard is shown one the left of each module/chapter/flashcard whenever a `list` command is used.
    * <b>Example of index:<b><br>
    <img src="UG_Images/Index.png" width="600" alt="Index"/>
    
### 3.1. Admin Level
This section introduces the syntax and usages of the commands for the features that are available at the **Admin Level**.<br>
Ensure that you are at the **Admin Level** before trying the commands in the next few sections:<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/AdminLevel.png" width="600" alt="Admin Level"/>
</p>

#### 3.1.1. Adding a module: `add`

Welcome to the first feature of KAJI! In order to use this program, you first will need to create a module deck. Creating a new module deck in KAJI is like getting a new folder to store all the handouts for one module. This is important because it helps you to organize your messy notes. <br>

**Format:** `add MODULE_NAME`
MODULE_NAME is the name of the new module that you would like to create, such as `CS2113`, `Module 1` or `Biology`. 

Here are some key pointers:
* KAJI does not allow duplicate of module names, therefore, if the existing module has the same name as the new module, you will get an error message.
* KAJI is not case-sensitive, therefore, a new module named `module`  will be treated equally to a module named `MODULE`. 
* KAJI only allows creation of one module with the `add` command. If you enter command `add CS2113T CS2101` will creates a module named `CS2113T CS2101`, instead of two separated modules named `CS2113T` and `CS2101` respectively.

**Example:**
 
In this example, you are going to add a new module called `CS2113T`. <br>
Below are steps of using this `add` command: <br>
* Step 1: Enters the command `add CS2113T` into the command prompt. Your new module name comes after the key word `add`. <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/addModule1.png" alt="Add Module 1"/>
</p>


* Step 2: As shown below, a new module named `CS2113T` has just been created! You are free to edit, delete and access this module! <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/addModule2.png" alt="Add Module 2"/>
</p>

This is an additional example to show you the unique property of KAJI's add feature. <br>
As you may aware from `Key Pointers` section above, KAJI is case-insensitive. This example belows shows you what will happen if you try to add a new module called `cs2113t` after completing the previous example. <br>
Below are the breakdown of this example: <br>
* Step 1: Types `add cs2113t` to add a new module named `cs2113t` after adding a module named `CS2113T` which essentially have a same name as our new module but in capital letters.<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/addModule3.png" alt="Add Module 3"/>
</p>
* Step 2: Opps, Kaji refuses to add the module `cs2113t` because a module with the same name is already existed!<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/addModule4.png" alt="Add Module 4"/>
</p>


This is another additional example to show you the unique property of Kaji's add feature. <br>
As you may aware from `Key Pointers` section above, Kaji only allows addition of one new module each time. Let's see what will happen if you try to add two modules `cs2113 cs2101` at same time. <br>
Below are the breakdown of this example: <br>
* Step 1: Types `add cs2113t cs2101` and attempts to add a new module named `cs2113t` and another new module `cs2101`. <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/addModule5.png" alt="Add Module 5"/>
</p>
* Step 2: Opps, Kaji has interpreted it as one single module with the name of `cs2113t cs2101`, instead of two seperate modules. <br> 
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/addModule6.png" alt="Add Module 6"/>
</p>

#### 3.1.2. Listing modules available: `list` 

After adding modules to the admin, you can view the list of modules that you have for the admin by using the `list` command.

**Format:** `list`

Here are some key pointers:
* Do not need to add parameter `admin` after `list`.
* All list commands have the same command word `list`. 


**Example:**

* Step 1: Type `list` into the command prompt and press `Enter` to execute it.<br>

<p align="center">
    <img src="UG_Images/list_module1.png" alt="List Module 1"/>
</p>

* Step 2: The result for the list of modules will be displayed as shown.<br>

<p align="center">
    <img src="UG_Images/list_module2.png" alt="List Module 2"/>
</p>

* After listing all modules, you can try all commands available in **Admin Level**.

#### 3.1.3. Editing a module name: `edit` 

You can edit the name of an existing module from the list of modules by using the `edit` command, followed by the edited name of the module.

**Format:** `edit MODULE_INDEX MODULE_NAME`

Here are some key pointers:
* You can only edit content on the level below the one you are on.
* The `MODULE_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed content list.
* The `MODULE_INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …
* The `MODULE_NAME` is the edited name of your module.

**Example:**

Let's say you want to edit the module name to `CS2113T` for the module `cs2113`.
* Step 1: Type `list` into the command prompt and press `Enter` to execute it.<br>

<p align="center">
    <img src="UG_Images/EditModule1.png" alt="Edit Module 1"/>
</p>

* Step 2: From the list of modules displayed, you can see that the module `MODULE_INDEX` is 1.<br>

<p align="center">
    <img src="UG_Images/EditModule2.png" alt="Edit Module 2"/>
</p>

* Step 3: Next, you can type `edit 1 CS2113T` into the command prompt and press `Enter` to execute it.<br>

<p align="center">
    <img src="UG_Images/EditModule3.png" alt="Edit Module 3"/>
</p>

* Step 4: After the module name has been successfully edited, the result will be displayed as shown.<br>

<p align="center">
    <img src="UG_Images/EditModule4.png" alt="Edit Module 4"/>
</p>

* After editing the module name, you can try all commands available in **Admin Level**.

#### 3.1.4. Removing a module: `remove` 

Removes a module from KAJI.

**Format:** `remove MODULE_INDEX`

Here are some key pointers:
* Removes the module based on the index provided.
* `MODULE_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the current module list. 
* Index provided **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...


**Example:**

For instance, you are currently at the admin level and want to remove the module `CS2113T`, the steps to do so are shown below:
* Step 1: Enter the command `remove 1` to remove the first module in the list which in this case is `CS2113T`: <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/RemoveMod1.PNG" width="600" alt="Remove Module 1"/>
</p>

* Step 2: The module as well as the chapters and flashcards in it are removed, and the output message below will be shown: <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/RemoveMod2.PNG" width="600" alt="Remove Module 2"/>
</p>

#### 3.1.5. Accessing the module level: `go`

Now you have learnt how to create, edit and delete the module deck, let's move to the next page. You can now access the module deck you have created by using the command `go MODULE_INDEX`.
**Format:** `go MODULE_INDEX`

Here are some key pointers:
* Kaji only allow access to the existing modules that are shown in the list, therefore, module that is deleted or has never been created will result in an error message.
* `MODULE_INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ..., and must be a valid index number for a module as displayed from the list of module.


**Example:**

In this example, you are going to access the module `CS2113T` that you have created in the previous sections.
Below are steps of using this `go` command:
* Step 1: Uses `list` command to check the index of the module that you would like to access. <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/goModule1.png" alt="Go Module 1"/>
</p>
* Step 2: In this example, the module you would like to access is `CS2113T` and its index is `2` as shown as the diagram below. <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/goModule2.png" alt="Go Module 2"/>
</p>
* Step 3: You can type `go 2` to access this module. <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/goModule3.png" alt="Go Module 3"/>
</p>
* Step 4: As shown below, you are now at a module level named **CS2113T** <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/goModule4.png" alt="Go Module 4"/>
</p>
* Step 5: You may double check your access using the command prompt directory displayed on top of `Enter command here:`. As shown as the diagram, your current access directory is under `Admin/CS2113T`. <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/goModule5.png" alt="Go Module 5"/>
</p>

### 3.2. Module level
This section introduces the syntax and usages of the commands for the features that are available at the **Module Level**.<br>
Ensure that you are at the **Module Level** before trying the commands in the next few sections:<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/ModuleLevel.png" width="600" alt="Module Level"/>
</p>

#### 3.2.1. Adding a chapter: `add`

You are now at the module level! This command allows you to create a new chapter inside your current module deck. It belongs to the module level you are currently in. It is like preparing an empty paper to write notes for a lecture. Let's create a new chapter inside the module! <br>

**Format:** `add CHAPTER_NAME`
CHAPTER_NAME is the name of the new chapter that you would like to create, such as `Topic 1`, `Chapter 1` or `Newton's laws of motion`. 

Here are some key pointers:
* Similar to module, KAJI does not allow duplicate of chapter names, therefore, if the existing chapter has the same name as the new chapter, you will get an error message
* KAJI is not case-sensitive, therefore, a new chapter named `chapter`  will be treated equally to a module named `CHAPTER`. 


**Example:**

In this example, you are going to add a new chapter called `Chapter 1`. <br>
Below are steps of using this `add` command: <br>
* Step 1: Enters the command `add Chapter 1` into the command prompt which your new chapter name comes after the key word `add`. <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/addChapter1.png" alt="Add Chapter 1"/>
</p>
* Step 2: In Kaji, you can give new chapters a rate to pre-set its revision schedules. If you would like to keep it as fault state, you can simply enter `N`. To demonstrate this feature fully, you may enter `Y` to rate the new chapter and check out how will Kaji responses! <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/addChapter2.png" alt="Add Chapter 2"/>
</p>
* Step 3: You choose to rate the new chapter from the previous step, therefore, you can rate your chapter as `Easy`, `Medium` or `Hard` by entering `E`, `M` and `H` as shown as the instruction given by Kaji. <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/addChapter3.png" width="600" alt="Add Chapter 3"/>
</p>
* Step 4: You have just created a new chapter! Good Job! <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/addChapter4.png" width="600" alt="Add Chapter 4"/>
</p>

#### 3.2.2. Listing chapters available: `list`

After adding chapters to the module, you can view the list of chapters that you have for the module by using the `list` command.

**Format:** `list`

Here are some key pointers:
* Do not need to add parameter `module_name` after `list`.
* All list commands have the same command word `list`. 

**Example:**

* Step 1: Type `list` into the command prompt and press `Enter` to execute it.<br>

<p align="center">
    <img src="UG_Images/list_chapter1.png" width="600" alt="List Chapter 1"/>
</p>

* Step 2: The result for the list of chapters will be displayed as shown.<br>

<p align="center">
    <img src="UG_Images/list_chapter2.png" width="600" alt="List Chapter 2"/>
</p>

* After listing all chapters, you can try all commands available in **Module Level**.


#### 3.2.3. Editing a chapter name: `edit`

You can edit the name of an existing chapter from the list of chapters.
You can do so by using the `edit` command, followed by the edited name of the chapter.

**Format:** `edit CHAPTER_INDEX CHAPTER_NAME`

Here are some key pointers:
* `CHAPTER_INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...,
and must be a valid index number for a chapter as displayed from the list of chapters.
* `CHAPTER_NAME` is the edited name of your chapter.

**Example:**

Let's say you want to edit the chapter name to `Chapter 1` for the chapter `chap 1`.
* Step 1: Type `list` into the command prompt and press `Enter` to execute it.<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/EditChapter1.png" width="600" alt="Edit Chapter 1"/>
</p>
* Step 2: From the list of chapters displayed, you can see that the chapter `CHAPTER_INDEX` is 1.<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/EditChapter2.png" width="600" alt="Edit Chapter 2"/>
</p>
* Step 3: Next, you can type `edit 1 Chapter 1` into the command prompt and press `Enter` to execute it.<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/EditChapter3.png" width="600" alt="Edit Chapter 3"/>
</p>


* Step 4: After the chapter name has been successfully edited, the result will be displayed as shown.<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/EditChapter4.png" width="600" alt="Edit Chapter 4"/>
</p>

#### 3.2.4. Removing a chapter: `remove`

Removes a chapter from KAJI.

**Format:** `remove CHAPTER_INDEX`

Here are some key pointers:
* Removes the chapter based on the index provided.
* `CHAPTER_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the current chapter list. 
* Index provided **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

**Example:**

For instance, you are currently at the module level `CS2113T` and want to remove the chapter `Chapter 1`, the steps to do so are shown below:
* Step 1: Enter the command `remove 1` to remove the first chapter in the list which in this case is `Chapter 1`: <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/RemoveChap1.PNG" width="600" alt="Remove Chapter 1"/>
</p>
* Step 2: The chapter and the flashcards in it are removed, and the output message below will be shown: <br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/RemoveChap2.PNG" width="600" alt="Remove Chapter 2"/>
</p>


#### 3.2.5. Accessing the chapter level: `go` 

Proceeds to the Chapter Level with reference to one of the Chapters within the module.

**Format:** `go CHAPTER_INDEX`
 
**Example:**

For instance, you are currently in Module level `CS2113T` and want to head to Chapter level `Chapter 1` , the steps to do so are shown below:

#### 3.3.6. Checking overall performance for a chapter: `showrate`

Congratulations! You have learnt how to add flashcards and revise your flash cards, and now is the time to **check your overall performance** for a chapter. <br>

It is very simple, all you have to do is to enter the command [`showrate`](#) in prompt. <br>

**Format:** `showrate`

Here are some key pointers:
* This command is only accessible in the chapter level. You will get an error message if you are in the wrong access level.
* Only overall performance of your current chapter level will be computed.
* Cards that has yet be answered will be label as <cannot answer>, therefore, if you find a `1.0` for `the percentage of cards that is labeled <cannot answer>`, don't panic, it will be updated as soon as you finish your first revision session of this particular chapter.
>:information_source: <b>Note:</b> As you now know, it is the level which you can add/edit/delete cards.

**Example:** 

For instance, you would like to check your overall performance after completing several rounds of revision. <br>
Below are steps of using this `showrate` command: <br>

### 3.4 Scheduling in KAJI

Now that you know how to make KAJI manage your Database of revision content for you, **what about scheduling?** For your benefit, the **scheduling** in KAJI is mostly **automated**! 

**You don't have to do a thing** to enjoy the benefits of Spaced Repetition. Everything is scheduled for you, so all you have to do is to use the commands `due` and `preview` to view what chapters are due and complete the revision  for them accordingly. 

Despite that, this **does not mean that you cannot customise** the scheduling process. KAJI allows you to `reschedule`, `include` and `exclude` Chapters manually if you wish to do so, but more on that later. First, let us get into the specific introduction of each command.

### 3.4.1. Listing the chapters due for today: `due`

As you now know, **each Chapter will be scheduled** to be due on a date. However, it will be **tedious** for you to go through each chapter **one by one** to find their deadlines. Our **solution** to that, is the `due` command.

The `due` command simplifies the process for by **showing you the Chapters that you have scheduled on that day** and the Modules they belong to.
<br><br>


**Format:** `due`


Here are some key pointers:
* There are **no parameters** for this command.
* This command can be **called from any Level**


**Example:**
 
At any point, if you want to **see what Chapters are due**, all you have to do is enter the `due` command. Below is an example of an execution of the `due` command.

* ***Step 1***: Key the **`due`** command **into the prompt** as shown below and **press *[Enter]***

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/due.png" width="700" alt="Due Command"/>
</p>

* ***Upon completion***: This is what you will see:

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/dueComplete.png" width="700" alt="Due Command Result"/>
</p>

### 3.4.2. Listing the chapters that are due in the upcoming week: `preview`

Beyond simply being able to view the Chapters that are due on the day itself, what if you would like to **view your upcoming revision schedule** so that you can **plan ahead**? For that specific purpose, we have the `preview` command.

The `preview` command shows you **the Chapters that you have scheduled for each day of the upcoming week** and the Modules that they belong to.
<br>

**Format:** `preview`

Here are some key pointers:
* There are **no parameters** for this command.
* This command can be **called from any Level**


**Example:** 

At any point, if you **want to see a preview of which Chapters are going to be due within the upcoming week**, all you have to do is enter the `preview` command. Below is an example of an execution of the `preview` command.


* ***Step 1***: Key the **`preview`** command **into the prompt** as shown below and **press *[Enter]***

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/preview.png" width="700" alt="Preview Command"/>
</p>

* ***Upon completion***: This is what you will see:

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/previewComplete.png" width="700" alt="Preview Command Result"/>
</p>

### 3.4.3. Adding chapters to your list of excluded modules: `exclude`

Apart from viewing your schedule, what if the Semester has ended and you would like to take a Module or Chapter out of your schedule? If you were to remove the files from your database completely, it would be really tedious to add the content back Card by Card. Therefore, we created the `exclude` command.

The `exclude` command allows you to **add** a single Chapter or every Chapter from a Module to your Exclusion list so that you can **remove these items** from your schedule.
<br>

**Format:** `exclude MODULE_OR_CHAPTER`
The `exclude` command has two options for MODULE_OR_CHAPTER:
* ***module***: This option allows you to use `exclude` to add all the Chapters from a Module into the Exclusion List.
* ***chapter***: This option allows you to use `exclude` to add a Chpater into the Exclusion List.


Here are some key pointers:
* This command can be **called from any Level**
* This command **checks if the Chapter/Module** you are adding into the Exclusion List **exists**, so the List will not be filled with non-existing exclusions.
* Do note that the name of the Chapter/Module you provide has to be in the correct case as our check is **case-sensitive**.


**Example:**

At any point, if you would like to **add to your Exclusion List**, all you have to do is enter the `exclude` command with the choice of "module" or "chapter" in the format specified above. Below are examples of the execution of the `exclude` command using both options.

Example of ***`exclude module`***
* ***Step 1***: Key the **`exclude module`** command **into the prompt** as shown below and **press *[Enter]***

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/excludeModule.png" width="700" alt="Exclude Command Module mode: Command"/>
</p>

* ***Step 2***: Key the **Module name** that you wish to exclude from your schedule **into the prompt** as shown below and **press *[Enter]***

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/excludeModuleModule.png" width="700" alt="Exclude Command Module mode: ModuleName Filled"/>
</p>

* ***Upon completion***: This is what you will see:

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/excludeModuleResult.png" width="900" alt="Exclude Command Module mode: Result"/>
</p>

Example of ***`exclude chapter`***
* ***Step 1***: Key the **`exclude chapter`** command **into the prompt** as shown below and **press *[Enter]***

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/excludeChapter.png" width="700" alt="Exclude Command Chapter mode: ChapterName Command"/>
</p>


* ***Step 2***: Key the **Module name** of the Module that contains Chapter that you wish to exclude from your schedule **into the prompt** as shown below and **press *[Enter]***

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/excludeChapterModule.png" width="700" alt="Exclude Command Module mode: ModuleName Prompt"/>
</p>

* ***Step 3***: Key the **Chapter name** that you wish to exclude from your schedule **into the prompt** as shown below and **press *[Enter]***

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/excludeChapterChapter.png" width="700" alt="Exclude Command Chapter mode: ChapterName Filled"/>
</p>

* ***Upon completion***: This is what you will see:

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/excludeChapterResult.png" width="900" alt="Exclude Command Chapter mode: Result"/>
</p>

### 3.4.4. Removing chapters from the list of excluded modules: `include`

However, what should be done if you had excluded the Chapters of a Module from your schedule, only to find that it is a prerequisite for another module the next semester. To prepare for the upcoming semester, you would like to revise the excluded content again. This is why we created the `include` command.

The `include` command allows you to **remove** a single Chapter or every Chapter from a Module from your Exclusion list so that you can **add these items** back into your schedule.
<br>

**Format:** `include MODULE_OR_CHAPTER`
The `include` command has two options for MODULE_OR_CHAPTER:
* ***module***: This option allows you to use `include` to remove all the Chapters from a Module from the Exclusion List.
* ***chapter***: This option allows you to use `include` to remove a Chpater from the Exclusion List.


Here are some key pointers:
* This command can be **called from any Level**
* Do note that the name of the Chapter/Module you provide has to be in the correct case as our check is **case-sensitive**.

**Example:**

At any point, if you wish to **remove from your Exclusion List**, you can either enter the `include` command with the choice of either "chapter" or "module" in the format specified above. Below are examples of the command's execution using both options.

Example of ***`include module`***
* ***Step 1***: Key the **`include module`** command **into the prompt** as shown below and **press *[Enter]***

<p align="center">
  <img src="UG_Images/includeModule.png" width="700" alt="Include Command Module mode: ModuleName Command"/>
