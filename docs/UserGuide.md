tasks and events having a similar description. For example, if you are looking for events happening on the same date
, you can use this feature to exclude all deadline tasks with the same date!

Format: `/fe <keyword>`

Note: The space in the command above is mandatory!

Example: 

`/fe 09-Nov-2020`

This displays the list of events containing the keyword “09-Nov-2020”.

![find_event_command](images/find_event_command.PNG)

When you have important tasks, you can prioritize them in the task list to distinguish from ordinary tasks.
If you want to prioritize an important task, you can use `*t <task_number>` to mark the task as important. 
    
Format: `*t <task_number>`

Note: The space in the command above is optional!
    
Example: 

`*t 1` 

This marks the first task in the task list as important.

![prioritizing_command](images/prioritizing_command.PNG)

 Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output will
 differ if you have a different task stored in the task index number 1.

![warning_prioritizing](images/warning_prioritizing.PNG)

### Printing tasks:

If you want to prioritize or delete some of the tasks on hand but cannot recall the task number as there are simply 
too many tasks, you can always ask _**25HoursADay**_ to print out all tasks saved in the application. 
In this way, you can have a better picture of the tasks on hand! 

Format: `print tasks`

Note: The space in the command above is mandatory and should only have 1 spacing.

Example:

`print tasks`

This prints all tasks stored in the application.

![printTasks](images/printTasks_command.png)

Note: The above figure is for illustration purpose only. The desired output will
differ if you have different tasks stored in the calendar list.

Note: The events are printed in the order of how the user added them, this is to facilitate other commands such as marking a
task as done or deleting a task.

![tips_printtask](images/tip_printTasks.PNG)

### Printing events:

If you want to delete past events or to add additional information to a certain event, you can always ask the application 
to display all events saved in the application. This feature will definitely save your brain space wasted on memorising them.

Format: `print events`

Note: The space in the command above is mandatory and should only have 1 spacing.

Example:

`print events`

This prints all events stored in the application.

![printEvents](images/printEvents_command.png)

differ if you have different events stored in the calendar list.

Note: The events are printed in the order of how the user added them, this is to facilitate other commands such as adding 
additional information for an event or deleting an event.

![tips_printevents](images/tip_printEvents.PNG)

### Printing important tasks:
    
If you just want to view all the important tasks instead of all the tasks in the calendar list now, 
you can type `print *` command to view the list of important tasks together with their information.                           
                                                    
Format: `print *`

Note: The space in the command above is mandatory and should only have 1 spacing.

Example:

`print *`

### Giving suggestion: 

When you have a lot of tasks and do not know preparing for which several tasks first, you can get some simple suggestions from the 25HoursADay. 
This application can select several important and urgent tasks in the task list for you. If you want to view the suggestions, 
you can type the `suggestion` command to see the recommended tasks together with their information.  
    
Format: `suggestion`

Example:

`suggestion`
