## Introduction (Chan Wan Ting Elizabeth)

Plan&Score is an application consisting of 2 key components:

* Event scheduler
* Quiz component

and a sub-component:

* Contact list


These components aim to tackle the issue of poor planning and revision most Primary 6 students in Singapore face.

This application uses a command line interface, meaning that you operate the application by typing commands into a Command Box.

#### Adding a Quiz Question: `add quiz` (Andre Wong Zhi Hua)
Allows you to add a Mathematics multiple-choice quiz question to the quiz list.

Note that the `/e (explanation)` is an optional parameter. You can add a quiz question with or without an explanation.

First, enter `add quiz`, follow by `/q`.

Then, enter the question you would like to add.

Next, enter `/o1`, followed by the answer option you would like to enter. Repeat this for the rest of the three options.

Now, enter `/a`, followed by the number corresponding to the correct answer option.

Lastly, enter `/e`, followed by the explanation to the solution of the question. This last part is optional.

An example of such a command would be: `add quiz /q What is 26+5? /o1 28 /o2 31 /o3 38 /o4 41 /a 2 /exp Adding 5 to 26 gives us 31.`.

The corresponding output would then be displayed as shown below.

In the case when you have many contacts in your list and you need to find a specific contact, you can use the 
`find contact` command to look for the contact you want by entering keywords related to it.

into the command box, and press 'Enter' to execute it.

## Saving Data (Chan Xu Hui)
Plan&Score saves all your data automatically after every command. There is no need to save manually.
However, if your storage file is detected to be unreadable, Plan&Score will offer to reset itself to its default settings,
wiping all data stored in the text file.

![factoryreset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-4/tp/master/docs/images/storage_corrupted_factory_reset.png)

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: We recommend you to transfer the entire folder containing `[CS2113T-W12-4][ Plan&Score].jar` and the `data` directory. Then, follow instructions given in our `Quick Start` section to set up Plan&Score.

## Troubleshooting (Chan Xu Hui)

**Q**: Plan&Score is unable to start, and I do not want to lose my data through factory resetting. How can I fix this?

**A**: Your data files might have been corrupted. To fix this, you can attempt the following steps:

**We recommend adult supervision for this process.**

1. Locate the `data` directory. It should be in the same directory as where Plan&Score is located.
1. Open the `events.txt` file.
1. Check if any of the data are violating our decoding formats:
  * For class/cca/test, the format should be: `[IDENTIFIER]|[true/false]|[DESCRIPTION]|[DATE IN YYYY-MM-DD HHMM]|[DATE IN YYYY-MM-DD HHMM]`
  * For tuition, the format should be: `[IDENTIFIER]|[true/false]|[DESCRIPTION]|[DATE IN YYYY-MM-DD HHMM]|[DATE IN YYYY-MM-DD HHMM]|location`
1. Edit the file to the correct formats shown above
1. Launch Plan&Score
1. Confirm that Plan&Score runs without any error

In the unfortunate event where the error persists, please reset Plan&Score to factory settings.
We recommend keeping a duplicate of the contents in `events.txt` to assist with the re-adding of events.
1. Ensure you have duplicated `events.txt`
1. Delete `events.txt`
1. Launch Plan&Score
1. Confirm that Plan&Score runs without any error
1. `events.txt` should appear in the `data` directory
1. Copy any unaffected events from the duplicated file in Step 1
1. Re-add affected events through the command line interface
