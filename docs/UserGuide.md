# User Guide

## Introduction

_ModTracker_ is a desktop app for NUS students to track the time spent 
as well as tasks to do for each of their modules.
It helps students prioritise their work and 
balance their time spent amongst their modules. 
This app uses a Command Line Interface (CLI).

1. Refer to the Features section below for more details on the application's available commands.


## 2. Features <a name="features"></a>

### Notes:
1. Items in <> are the parameters to be supplied by the user,
   e.g. in `addmod <module code>`, `module code` is a parameter which can be used as such: `addmod CS2113T`.
1. All the module codes are case-insensitive. The app will convert the module codes to uppercase.
1. The module code is valid if it starts with 2 - 3 characters, followed by 4 digits and an optional character without 
   any spacing.
1. Definition of too much / too little time spent on a module: 
    1. A user spends too little time on a module if the user's actual workload is less than the expected 
workload by more than 30%. For example, if the expected workload is 10 hours,
but the actual workload is less than 7 hours, the program considers the user
to be spending too little time on the module.

    1. A user spends too much time on a module if the user exceeds the expected workload by at least 30%. 
For example, if the expected workload is 10 hours, but the actual workload is 13 hours or more,
the program considers the user to be spending too much time on the module.
    
    1. A user spends just the right amount of time on a module if the user spends between 70% to 130% of the 
expected workload. For example, if the expected workload is 10 hours, 
and the actual workload is between 7 hours (inclusive) and 13 hours (exclusive),
the program considers the user to be on track.

         |Analysis|Amount of time spent|
         |--------|--------|
         |Too little time|A < 70% E|
         |Just right|  70% E â‰¤ A < 130% E|
         |Too much time| A > 130% E |

          E - Expected workload <br>
          A - Actual time spent

### 2.3 Add expected module workload: `addexp` <a name="addexp"></a>
Adds the expected workload of the given module to the database. 
Every module in NUS has an expected workload, which is the expected

* The `module code` needs to be valid.
* The `expected workload` is expressed in hours. It has to be a number between 1 and 24 inclusive with a maximum of 1 
decimal place.
* If the `module code` already exists, this command replaces its expected workload with the new expected workload.
* If the `module code` does not exist, this command creates a new module and adds its expected workload to the database.

Example of usage:

`addexp cs2113t 10` 

Expected output(when CS2113T does not exist):
````
CS2113T, Expected Workload: 10.0h is added.

+------+---------+----------+----------+
````

### 2.6 Analyse actual time spent on all modules: `analyse` <a name="analyse"></a>
To further analyse the data, you can use the `analyse` command.
