<br/>

## 1. Introduction
**Welcome to AniChan!**

AniChan is a free desktop command-line application aimed to improve the efficiency of anime translators. With AniChan, translators could manage their time more effectively by identifying the time needed to translate a script. Moreover, AniChan comes with management features such as workspace, watchlist and bookmark that can help them stay organized and focused on their work.

AniChan can also be used on all major operating systems such as Windows and Linux. You can refer to the [Quick Start](#2-quick-start) guide located below for more information on getting your journey started with AniChan!

### 1.1 Purpose
This guide provides you with in-depth information on setting up AniChan and how to use the various features offered.

<br/>

### 1.2 Using this guide

Along the way you might encounter several icons. These icons can help provide several types of information that may be useful to you. 

> :bulb: Take note when you see this icon, as it might tell you something important.

> :memo: This icon represents a friendly tip that might be useful when using our application.

> :warning: A caution that you have to keep in mind when using the command

Lastly, text that are blue like this [example](#12-using-this-guide), are clickable links that will bring you to the relevant part of this user guide. 

<br/>

## 2. Quick Start
1.  Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2.  Download the latest version of **AniChan** from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-2/tp/releases/tag/V2.0).
3.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for **AniChan**.
4.  Open **command prompt** or **terminal** and change directory into the folder. Run `java -jar AniChan.jar`.
5.  You will be first greeted by the **command prompt** for your name and gender as shown below.
6.  Upon completing these 2 prompts, you can begin using **AniChan**!
7.  Type a command into the **command prompt** and press `Enter` to execute it. For example, typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will display a useful help message to get you started.

*Figure 1: Example of First Time Setup*

<br/>

## 3. Features 
**Some useful notes on the command format of AniChan**

*   Commands are case-sensitive. <br/>
E.g. Only `help` will work, and so `HELP`, `hElp`, and its other variant will not work.

*   All parameter options are lowercase letters. <br/>
E.g. `-l` in this case would be a lowercase letter of 'L'. Not to be mistaken with `1` or `I`.

*   Words in UPPERCASE are values that can be supplied to the command. <br/>
E.g. In `browse -s <SORT_CATEGORY> -p <PAGE_NO.>`, `SORT_CATEGORY` and `PAGE_NO.` can be replaced with `name` and `1` respectively. 

*   Angle brackets (`<MANDATORY>`) are mandatory, while square brackets (`[OPTIONAL]`) are optional. <br/>
E.g. `estimate <SCRIPT_NAME> [-t WORDS_PER_HOUR]` can be used as `estimate script.txt` or `estimate script.txt -wph 300`.

*   Order of parameters (`-n`, `-l`, etc.) are not important, but they have to be defined after the non-parameter fields. <br/>
E.g. Both `browse -s name -p 2` and `browse -p 2 -s name` gives the same result, but in the case of `estimate script.txt -wph 300` and `estimate -wph 300 script.txt`, the latter will not work because "script.txt" is not an parameter.

> :bulb: This is what the input prompt means: **WORKSPACE-NAME (WATCHLIST-NAME) #>**

<br/>

### 3.1 View the help
This command will provide the details of all available commands and their usage. 
This is done by displaying the ‘Command Summary’ as listed below to the user. 

Format: `help`

<br/>

### 3.2 Estimate time needed to translate the script
This command allows you to estimate the time needed to translate a script. It estimates based on the amount of words you can translate in an hour, or by using the average translators’ speed of 400, 500, and 600 words per hour. Hence, this would allow you to better manage and plan your time.

Format: `estimate <SCRIPT_FILE_NAME> [-wph WORDS_PER_HOUR]`
*   It only accepts one `.txt` file (other file extensions will be supported in a future version).
*   If the parameter `-wph` is not specified, the average translator's speed will be used to generate three estimations for you to consider.

> :bulb: Remember to specify the file extension. For example, `script.txt` and not `script`.

> :bulb: Put the script in the current workspace folder. If the current workspace is "Default", then from the folder containing `AniChan.jar`, put it in the subfolder named "Default" of the "data" folder (i.e. `data/Default/script.txt`) as shown in the diagram below. 
> <br/><br/> ![Estimate Folder Structure Diagram](images/Estimate-Folder-Structure-Diagram.png)

<br/>

Example of usage: `estimate script.txt`

The expected outcome: 
```
Average translator (400 words per hour) takes: 5 hour(s) 47 minute(s).
Average translator (500 words per hour) takes: 4 hour(s) 38 minute(s).
Average translator (600 words per hour) takes: 3 hour(s) 51 minute(s).
```
<br/>

Example of usage: `estimate script.txt -wph 777`

The expected outcome:
```
You would need 2 hour(s) 58 minute(s).
```
<br/>

### 3.3 Browse through anime
This command will provide a realistic **browsing** experience as you are able to ‘flip’ through pages of different anime series. This is a useful way to get a quick overview of all available anime series.

`browse` will also has various options to customise each browsing session by being able to sort the anime list.

Format: `browse [-s SORT_CATEGORY] [-o DISPLAY_ORDER] [-p PAGE_NUMBER`]
*   `-s` will indicate how the list is sorted and will accept the values `name` or `rating` 
*   `-o` will arrange the list in descending or ascending order by using the values `asc` or `dsc`
*   The order of the options does not matter
*   If no option or only `-o` is specified then it will display anime in no particular order.

> :memo: It will actually be sorted according to its ID which is assigned randomly by our data source.

<br/>

Here are some commonly used `browse` commands to get you started. Feel free to experiment with different combinations!
*   `browse -s name` browse alphabetically from A - Z
*   `browse -s rating -o dsc` browse starting from the most highly rated anime

<br/>

Example of usage: `browse -s name -o asc`

The expected outcome:

In the folder where **AniChan** is launched, there will be a `data` folder which would contain these data:
*   User data will be stored in `data/user.txt`.
*   Watchlist(s) data will be stored in `data/<WORKSPACE-NAME>/watchlist.txt`, e.g. if "AniTranslator" is the name of your workspace, then the watchlist data can be found in `data/AniTranslator/watchlist.txt`.
*   Bookmark(s) data will also be stored in the same location as watchlist data, `data/WORKSPACE-NAME/bookmark.txt`.

## 4. FAQ

<!-- @@author ChanJianHao -->
**Q:** What is a workspace?
<br/>
**A:** Workspace is a functionality in **AniChan** which provides users the flexibility to organise information. 
As application data like watchlist and bookmarks are linked to workspace, switching workspace would provide a 
clean slate environment to work in.
<br/>

**Q:** How can I save my data?
<br/>
**A:** **AniChan** automatically saves your data on every action you take. You can find them in `/data` folder in the same
directory you run **AniChan** in.
<br/>

**Q:** Can I edit the information in `data` directory?
<br/>
**A:** Yes! As **AniChan** saves and loads your information from the data directory, editing the files in `data` folder
works. However, we would strongly recommend you not to as you may cause data corruption. Use **AniChan** instead if you wish to edit your information!
