### 2.a Prerequisites

1. **JDK `11`**  
  
> **[NOTE]**
> The `WatchNext.jar` file is compiled using the Java version mentioned above.

2. **IntelliJ IDEA IDE**
 <br>  
> **[NOTE]**
> IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed by default.
> Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

### 2.b Setting up the project in your computer
 
 **Fork** this [repo](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-3/tp), and clone the fork to your computer.
 
1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)

2. You should set up the correct JDK version for Gradle

3. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`

4. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK

5. Click `Import Project`

6. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`

7. Click `Open as Project`

8. Click `OK` to accept the default settings

9. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all the resources required by the application and tests.

<br><br><br>

### 2.c Verifying the setup

1. You can run `Duke` and try a few commands.

2. You can also run tests using our instructions for manual testing to explore our features.

### 2.d Before Writing Code
 
 1. Set up CI (Continuous Integration) <br> <br> 
 This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows` folder). When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the master branch or to any PR. No set up required.
 
 2. Learn the design <br> <br> 
 When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about WatchNext’s architecture [here](#3-design).

## 3. Design

WatchNext was designed drawing from the ideas of the __Event-driven architectural style__. <br>
The class diagram below describes the relationship between the different components in **WatchNext**.<br><br>
<img src = "images/designDG/designArchitecture.png" width = "700"> <br><br>
<br>The Ui and the Scanner components work together as event emitters. The `Ui` class prompts the user for input, and the scanner is ready to receive the input. Should the format of the input be unrecognised or incorrect, the `Ui` class guides the user with prompts to rectify the errors.<br>
<br>Events will be passed onto the `InputParser` which serves as the dispatcher. The `InputParser` uses various string manipulation operations from the `StringOperations` class to recognise the intention of the user input. After recognising the command, the input will be parsed, and the command information will be passed onto the various command classes for processing. The `InputParser` communicates the events to event consumers which are the command classes in this case. <br>
<br>All available operations will be processed by the classes in the commands package. Every command class, like the `AddCommand` class, inherits from the `Command` class. Each individual command class is able to contain all the processing required for each command with the inputs passed in during the initiation of each command object. <br>
<br>During runtime, the show related data is all stored in the `ShowList` class. The data is accessible and can be modified statically by all the command classes. The `ShowList` contains `Show` objects which describes the attributes of a show. 
<br>Certain commands relating to the monitoring of the amount of time users spend watching shows depend on information from the `WatchTime` class. The class tracks the date and time remaining for the users to watch shows for the day. The time limit will be set by the user. <br>
<img src = "images/storageDG/StorageClassDiagram.png" width = "700"> <br><br>
This class diagram shows how the Storage class is setup as an example.<br>
<br>On the initiation of WatchNext, the `Storage` object will be initiated and retrieves any user data that has been saved from previous runs. The data is stored in plain text and can be manually edited by advanced users. The data is stored in `data/showList.txt`. After the execution of every command, the `Storage` object calls upon the save command to automatically update the save data file. The commands relating to saving and loading data can be accessed from the `SaveState` interface.<br>
<br>Throughout the lifespan of the program, various errors may occur. The `ErrorHandling` class stores the various errors that could occur. The expected errors usually stem from invalid user input or Input Output (IO) errors during file loading. The `Ui` class informs the users of the errors detected and suggests actions for rectification. <br>
<img src = "images/designDG/designSequence.png" width = "700"> <br><br>
This shows the flow of the program for one user command input.

 <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4. Implementation

### AddCommand

The `add` command allows users to add a new show which they are watching to the `ShowList`. It is invoked by the 
`InputParser` class.

Given below is an example of usage scenario of how the `add` command behaves at each step.

**Step 1**

* The user types in `add friends 2 10,10 30` , adding the `show` to the `Showlist` . The details added include the title
of the show, the number of seasons of the show, the number of episodes in each season(separated by the comma) and 
the duration of each episode. 

The `InputParser` class calls the `parseInput` method to parse the command.

> **[NOTE]** 
>
> `ArrayOutOfBoundsException` and `NullPointerException` is thrown when the number of arguments entered by the user is incorrect.

**Step 2**

* The `AddCommand` class calls the `AddCommand()` method which then creates a new instance of the `Show` class.


**Step 3**
* The user input is tokenized by the `AddCommand` method into 4 seperate parameters. (Title,Number of seasons,Number of
episodes for each season respectively,Duration of an episode)


**Step 4**

* A new `Show` instance is created with the 4 parameters created in step 3 using the default constructor for show.
* The duration of the show is parsed by the utility class `InputParser`.

**Step 5**

* AddCommand checks the `ShowList` for duplicates. If there are duplicates, the user is prompted if they would like to
overwrite the duplicate entry.
* The `Show` is added to the `ShowList`.
<br><br><br>

**Step 6** 

* The changes will be reflected to the user. Concurrently, the changes will be saved into the showList.txt file.

### EditCommand

The `edit` command allows the user to change the details of each show that they are watching after they have added the
show. It is self-contained, it includes its own parser and methods which prompts the user to change any parameter they 
wish, after the user enters `done`, the `edit` command replaces the old entry with the updated one.

Given below is an example of usage scenario of how the edit command behaves at each step and a sequence diagram to
illustrate the steps in a visual form.

> **[NOTE]** 
>
> `NullPointerException` will be thrown when show entered by user is not found in the showlist.

 &nbsp;
   
*Figure 1: Program Flow for Edit Command*

<img src = "images/EditCommand.png" width = "700">
 
 <br> 
*Figure 2: Sequence Diagram for Edit Command*


**Step 1**

* The user types in `edit friends` , where the show `friends` already exists in the showlist.

**Step 2**

* The `processCommand` method is called. The `processCommand` method will retrieve the existing show object from the showlist,
and make a copy of it.
* Then the system will prompt the user to edit the name,season,episodes or the 
duration (of an episode) respectively. 

**Step 3**

* The process command parses each line of the user input.
* The `EditCommand` class then calls the corresponding method, e.g. `editDuration()` to make the corresponding changes to the copy.

**Step 4**

* The user inputs `done`, and the copy of the `Show` object is inserted into the `ShowList`, replacing the old object.

### DeleteCommand
  
The `delete` command takes in 1 parameter, the show to be deleted. Following that, the command proceeds to delete the
`Show` from the `ShowList`. The `delete` command is invoked by the `InputParser` Method `parseDeleteCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `DeleteCommand` Class behaves at each step.

<img src = "images/DeleteCommand.png" width = "700">

*Figure 1: Sequence Diagram for Delete Command*

**Step 1**

* The user types in `delete friends` , assuming that friends has been added by the user beforehand.
The `parseInput` method in `InputParser` class is called to parse the command.

> **[NOTE]** 
>
> Customised `NullPointerException` will be thrown when show entered by user is not found in the show list.

**Step 2**

* A new instance of the `DeleteCommand` class is called and the command is returned to the main program. 
The `delete` method in `DeleteCommand` class is called.

**Step 3**

* The `delete` method retrieves the `Show` to be deleted from the `ShowList`.

**Step 4**

* The `Show` is deleted from the `ShowList`.

**Step 5**

* The changes are reflected back to the user. Concurrently, the changes will be saved to the showList.txt file.

### AddReviewCommand
The `addreview` command allows users to add a rating and a review for the show for future reference.
The `addreview` command takes in 2 parameters, the show which review is to be updated and the review to be updated
to the show. The `addreview` command is invoked by the `InputParser` method `parseAddReviewCommand()`.

**Step 1**

* The string is tokenised into 3 separate parts, the show name, rating and review.

**Step 2**

* The corresponding show is retrieved from the show list.

**Step 3**

* The rating of the show is updated.

**Step 4**

* The review of the rating is added to the show. If there is an existing review, the new review will overwrite the
 existing review.

**Step 5**

* The changes are reflected back to the user. Concurrently, the changes will be saved to the showList.txt file.

 <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### ChangeRatingCommand

The changes are reflected back to the user. Concurrently, the changes will be saved to the showList.txt file.

### WatchCommand

The `WatchCommand` class extends `Command` by providing methods to 
increment the current episode in the persistent watch history of the user. It also updates the watch time limit as indicated previously by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `WatchCommand` class behaves at each step.

**Step 1**

The `processCommand` method in `WatchCommand` class is called.

**Step 3**

* The `processCommand` method in `WatchCommand` class is then called. This method does three main things:

1.Check the status of user's watch progress: In middle of series , finished season and finished series.

2.Increment current episode  and new season if applicable. No change is done if user has finished series. 

3.Reflect the new changes to the user. A prompt is made to the user if the user has already finished the series. Changes are also saved in the `userData.txt` file.


The following sequence diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a `WatchCommand`:

 <img src = "images/WatchCommandSequence.png" width = "700">
 
 <br> 
 
 *Sequence diagram for Watch Command*

### UpdateShowEpisodeProgressCommand

The `UpdateShowEpisodeProgressCommand` class extends `Command` by providing methods to change
 the current episode in the persistent watch history of the user. 

**Step 1**

* User types in `updatesshowepisodeprogress friends 5`
* When the `InputParser` identifies the command, a new instance of the `UpdateShowEpisodeProgressCommand` will be created.

**Step 2**

*  `processCommand()` is called and the `currentEpisode` field of the specified show is updated via the `setEpisodeWatched()` command.


### UpdateShowSeasonCommand

The `UpdateShowSeasonCommand` class extends `Command` by providing methods to change
 the current season in the persistent watch history of the user. 

**Step 1**

* User types in `updatesshowseason friends 2`
* When the `InputParser` identifies the command, a new instance of the `UpdateShowSeasonCommand` will be created.

**Step 2**

*  `processCommand()` is called.

**Step 3**
* If only `currentSeason` is to be updated:

    * `updateSeasonOnly()` method is called.

    * `currentSeason` field of the specified show is updated via the `setCurentSeason()` command.

* If both `currentSeason` and `currentEpisode` are to be updated:

    * `updateSeasonAndEpisode()` method is called.

    * `currentSeason` field of the specified show is updated via the `setCurentSeason()` command, 
and the `currentEpisode` field of the specified show is updated via the `setEpisodeWatched()` command.

### UpdateTimeLimitCommand

The `UpdateTimeLimit` class extends `Command` by providing methods to 
update the current time limit of the user from the `WatchTime` class. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `UpdateTimeLimit` class behaves at each step.

**Step 1**

* The user types in `updatetimelimit 120`.
The `parseInput` method in `InputParser` class is called to parse the command.

> **[NOTE]** Customised `IndexOutOfBoundsException` and `NullPointerException` will be thrown if the user enters invalid commands.

**Step 2**

* A new instance of `UpdateTimeLimit` class is called and the command is returned to the main program. 
The `processCommand` method in `UpdateTimeLimit` class is called.

**Step 3**

* The `processCommand` method in `UpdateTimeLimit` class will call the `WatchTime` class and update its `dailywatchtime` variable
to the desired value, which is 120 in this case.

* The change will then be reflected to the user, and saved to the `userData.txt` file.

### Storage  

The Storage class is created and facilitated by `Duke`. It has an interface class `SaveState`. It implements the following operations:

 - `saveState()` ---- Save the show list and the watch time details into a file named `userData.txt`
 - `loadWatchTimeDetail()` ---- load the watch time detail from `userdata.txt` and create a `WatchTime` instance
 - `loadState()` ---- load the show list and watch time detail from `userdata.txt` and return a `ShowList` instance

**Step 1**
* The user starts up WatchNext. `Duke` creates a `Storage` class and specifies the file path of `userData.txt`.

**Step 2**
* `Duke` calls `loadState()` to load contains into WatchNext. `loadState()` first calls `loadWatchTimeDetail()` to load watch time details and then load show list.

**[NOTE]** 
* If the `data` folder and `userData.txt` do not exist, `loadState()` will create them under the same file path as the WatchNext.jar.

* If `Duke` catches any exception, an empty `ShowList` and `WatchTime` will be created.  

**Step 3**
* Every time the user inputs a command, `Duke` calls `saveState()` to save the current show list and watch time details into `userData.txt`. 

**[NOTE]** 
* The whole `userData.txt` will be rewrite to ensure that all changes are recorded.

**Step 4**
* The user inputs `bye`. The WatchNext program will terminate, and `userData.txt` is saved.

The following sequence diagram shows the working flow of `Storage` class.  

<img src = "images/StorageSequence.png" width = "550">  


### ErrorHandling

The `ErrorHandling` class extends `Exception` by providing the appropriate exception error message to the user when the program encounters an exception.

The following is an example execution scenario and demonstrates how the `ErrorHandling` class behaves and interacts with other relevant classes.

**Step 1**

* The user types in `updatetimelimit hello`.
The `parseInput` method in `InputParser` class is called to parse the command. The `processCommand` method in `UpdateTimeLimit` class is called.
The `processCommand` method will attempt to parse `hello` to an integer.

> **[NOTE]** At this instance `NumberFormatException` will be thrown as `hello` cannot be parsed to an integer.

**Step 2**

* The `parseUpdateTimeLimitCommand` method in `InputParser` class catches the thrown `NumberFormatException`. The `printInvalidFormatException` method in `Ui` class is called.

**Step 3**

* The `printInvalidFormatException` method in `Ui` class will call the `ErrorHandling` class and get the `EXCEPTION_INVALID_FORMAT` enumeration, along with its `exceptionMessage`.
The `Ui` class prints the `exceptionMessage` into the terminal.

### InputParser

* The InputParser reads in the user input, matches the user input with any possible command and invokes the command on the user's behalf.

* It detects any illegal inputs and throws the relevant exceptions.

### TimeParser

* The TimeParser class handles all functionality related to reading in the users' time input.

* It takes input in two different formats

1. `<A>h<B>m`
2. `<C>`

* Format 1 is in hours and minutes, while format 2 is in minutes only. The <> represent user input.

* The TimeParser will return -1 if the time input has any negative numbers, or if the number of hours exceed 24 or minutes exceed 59.

## 5. Documentation

This project comes with 2 pieces of documentation, the developers' guide, which you are reading right now and the user guide, which helps new users get acquainted with the program.
<br> Throughout the code JavaDocs was used to explain the individual classes and functions.

## 6. Testing


We have written J-Unit test for the main functionalities for the program, such as `command` classes. The test can be found under `/src/test`.

When using gradle to build the project, these tests are run automatically and will catch any runtime errors. If you have added new functionality, please remember to add a J-Unit test for the new functionality.


Two main forms of testing was used for the development of **WatchNext**. 

1. Text-ui-test
    1. This seeks to test the general flow of the program and simulates the "expected" or "smooth" lifespan of the program.
    2. This is useful to ensure that the changes to one class does not inadvertently affect the operation of another. Any changes to the operation of another class will show through this test and can be rectified by the developer.
    3. Text-ui-test is also a good final litmus test on the smooth running of the program before it is released to production. 
    
2. J-unit
    1. The test mainly focuses on the correctness of each individual class.
    2. This tests the functions within each class and ensures that it behaves as expected by testing the output of each function against what is expected.
    3. The benefits include ensuring that the coupling between the classes do not cause any unexpected behaviour when another class has been modified.
    4. The errors thrown from the J-unit tests allow the developer to zoom in on the classes which are not showing the expected behaviour to quickly and effectively rectify the bugs.


## 7. Dev Ops

After the project is finalised and released, if you find any bugs or problems, or if you have suggestions for new functionality, please create a new issue on our [github page](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-3/tp/issues).


##  Appendix A: Product Scope

### Target user profile

**WatchNext** is a program made for teenagers and young adults.For users who use multiple free streaming platforms or other open source stream websites,
the application will track their progress in the different shows they watch, and the upcoming shows they wish to watch.In addition, it provides a tracker 
to limit your daily show progress to help manage your time.

**WatchNext** is optimized for users who prefer to work with the Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Value proposition

There exists many options for streaming all sorts of video content from the giant media service provider company netflix, to other platforms that lean
towards user sourced content.<br><br> This poses a new challenge to any tech-savvy person who wants to make sure they do not miss a single episode of their 
favourite show. Netflix and other established streaming platforms are able to keep track of the user's progress, but should be the user use more than one
streaming platform, there is no avenue of communication between the streaming platforms to synchronise this data.<br><br> **WatchNext** seeks to fill in this gap 
by providing users with a single streamlined platform to keep track of the episodes of all their favourite shows. They do not need to worry about re-watching
or missing episodes with the help of **WatchNext's** show progress tracking features. <br>
<br>**WatchNext** also helps users track the total time they spend watching shows across all platforms. This provides users with an encompassing view of the
actual time they spend watching shows and is a feature that is not provided by most other platforms.
