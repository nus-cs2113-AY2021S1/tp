# Developer Guide

## Design & implementation

The app was mainly inspired by [addressbook-level2](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2).

### Design
The App consists of a few main components.

* Ui: The UI that deals with getting user input and displaying output.
* Command: Command to be executed.
* Parser: Parse user input and make sense of it.
* Storage: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* Rex: The main class that initialize the app and starts running.

The rest are just objects that the app requires.

The diagram below shows the basic design.

The complete class diagram is shown below.

### Implementation
The commands are implemented in such a way as we are able to have one class for every command, which allows for more extendability and less coupling, since we are likely to add more commands over time. We considered other alternatives such as putting all commands in one command class, however there are way too many methods and coupling.

#### Retrieve Command
The flow for the retrieve command is as follows:
![image info](./pictures/retrieveCommandSD.png)
1. Retrieve command extracts NRIC using parser. 
2. Retrieve command searches through the patients list and obtains the patient's index.
3. Patients list returns the patient.
4. Ui object prints the patient.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br><br>

#### Add Command
The flow for add command is as follows:
![image_info](./pictures/addCommandSD.PNG)
1. Add command extracts NRIC by calling its own method.
2. Add command checks patients list if NRIC already exists. Add command ends if so.
3. Add command calls Ui object to get the patient name and date of birth from user.
4. Patient list adds the new patient.
5. Add command obtains the newly added patient.
6. Ui receives the call to print the patient.
7. The updated patients list is saved by the Storage object.

#### Book Command
The flow for the book command is shown in the sequence diagram below:
![image info](./pictures/bookCommandSD.PNG)
1. Book command checks if there are available appointments.
2. Book command extracts NRIC by calling its own method.
3. Book command calls Ui to get the corresponding doctor name for the appointment.
4. Book command calls Ui to get the selected appointment.
5. The appointment is updated with the patient and doctor.
6. Ui prints the booked appointment message.
7. The updated appointments list is saved by Storage.

#### Edit Command
The flow for the edit command is shown in the sequence diagram below:

#### Delete Patient Command
The flow for the delete patient command is shown in the sequence diagram below:

## Product scope
### Target user profile

Administrative staff of hospitals who are overworked from having various responsibilities with repetitive tasks relating to doctors and patients.

### Value proposition

Aim: To facilitate the role of the administrative staff and help them automate most of the mundane tasks that they have to do. This enables the admin staff to have a one stop application to handle appointments and fees across different specialised clinics in the hospital. Administrative staff will have more time to help patients or do things that are more meaningful, such as answering queries from patients or doctors.
