## 1. Introduction <a name="1"></a>
_ModTracker_ is a desktop app for NUS students to track the time spent 
as well as tasks to do for each of their modules.
It helps students prioritise their work and 
balance their time spent amongst their modules. 
This app uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) and is written in Java 11.

## 2. Setting Up, Getting Started <a name="2"></a>

### 2.1 Setting up the project in your local machine <a name="2.1"></a>
Ensure that you have JDK 11 or above installed on your computer. 

First, **fork** this [repo](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-4/tp), and **clone** a copy to your computer by using any Git client.

If you plan to use IntelliJ IDEA (highly recommended):
1. Ensure IntelliJ is configured to use JDK 11.
    * Start up IntelliJ into the welcome page.
    * Click on `Configure` -> `Structure for New Projects` -> `Project Settings` -> `Project`.
    * Under the `Project SDK:` section, ensure that the correct SDK (**java version "11.0.8"** or higher) is selected.
1. Import the project as a Gradle project.
    * At the same welcome page, click on `Open or Import`.
    * Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo, locate the `build.gradle` file within the folder and select it.
    * Choose the `Open as Project` option when asked.
    * The project may take a couple of minutes to import depending on your actual computer hardware setup.
1. Verify the setup.
    * Under the `seedu.modtracker` package, locate the `ModTracker` class and run it.
    * Try a few commands. You may want to refer to the [user guide](https://ay2021s1-cs2113t-f12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html).
    * Run the [tests](Testing.md) to ensure they all pass.

### 2.2 Before writing the code <a name="2.2"></a>
1. Configure the coding style
    * If using IntelliJ IDEA, follow this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) to set up IDEA's coding style to match ours.
    
1. Set up CI
    * This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows` folder). When GitHub detects those files, 
    it will run the CI for the project automatically at each push to the `master` branch or to any PR.
    No setup is required for this.
    
1. Learn the design
    * When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you look at [ModTracker's architecture](#3.1) to get some 
    sense of the overall design.


## 3. Design <a name="3"></a>

### 3.1 Architecture <a name="3.1"></a>
![Architecture](diagrams/Architecture.png) 
<br/> Figure 1. Architecture Diagram


The **Architecture Diagram** given above explains the high-level design of the App. 
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

The `Main` component is the main entry point for the ModTracker application. It contains the main, loadData, run, 
startAndGetName and runCommandLoopUntilExitCommand methods. The methods are responsible for:
* At app launch:
    * Creation of a ModTracker object.
    * Load previously saved data from the text file into ModTracker.
    * Run the ModTracker app.
* At runtime:
    * Continuously prompt the user for input until app termination.
* At shut down:
    * Save user data into a text file.
    * Invoke clean up methods where necessary.
    
The rest of the app consists of 4 components:
* `Ui` : The user interface of the app.
* `Parser` : Parses the user input and calls the corresponding methods.
* `Model` : Holds the data of the app in-memory, containing the classes: ModuleList, Module, TaskList and Task.
* `Storage` : Saves and loads data to and from the hard disk.

##### How the architecture components interact with each other

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user types 
the command `addmod CS2113T`.  

![highlevelsequencediagram](diagrams/highlevelsequencediagram.png)
<br/> Figure 2. Component interactions for `addmod CS2113T` command

### 3.2 UI component <a name="3.2"></a>

`UI` consists of a UI class that is responsible for dealing with user interaction. 

The `UI` component,
* Reads in the user input and passes the user input to the `Parser` component.
* Displays the message to the user based on the commands inputted by the user. 

### 3.3 Parser component <a name="3.3"></a>

The `Parser` component,
* Determines whether the user input is valid.
* Identifies the command to be executed.
* Passes the required information and calls the respective function
to execute the command.

### 3.4 Model component <a name="3.4"></a>

![modelcomponent](diagrams/modelcomponent.png)
<br/> Figure 3. Structure of the Model Component


The `Model`,
* Consists of ModuleList class that supports functions to execute module-related commands, 
  such as addmod, deletemod etc.
* Consists of Module class that represents the module.
* Consists of TaskList class that supports functions to execute task-related commands, 
  such as addtask, deletetask etc.
* Consists of Task class that represents the task.

### 3.5 Storage component <a name="3.5"></a>
The `Storage` component,
* Loads data from an external file at the start of the program.
* Saves valid data to the file after any changes. 
* Locks the file to read-only mode before the program ends.

## 4. Implementation <a name="4"></a>
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are being implemented.

### 4.1 Store Data <a name="4.1"></a>
The storage feature saves the data of the user so that 
the ModTracker application continues from where the user left off the previous time. 

#### Current Implementation 
The `Storage` class facilitates the data saving and loading mechanism. 
The constructor `Storage(filePath)` accepts a String which is the file path to an external file.
This external file stores the user's data locally.

Inside the external file, it stores the name of the user 
followed by any valid inputs which modifies the data.
The format of the data inside the external file is as follows:

````
username
valid user input 1
valid user input 2
valid user input 3
...
````

When the user runs the program again, 
the program will first load data from the external file.
The `Parser` class then parses these data 
before the program prompts the user for input.

Given below is an example usage scenario, showing the 2 different times 
when a user starts the application.

##### First Use
The user launches the application for the first time.

1. `ModTracker` creates a new `Storage` object 
with file path at `data/modtracker.txt`. 

1. The newly created `Storage` object checks that there is no file 
at the specified file path, and creates a new file there.

1. The program prompts the user to input his/ her name.

1. The `Storage` object writes this username into the external file.

1. The program prompts the user for further inputs.

1. The user enters `help`, and the program displays the help message. 
Since this command does not modify the data, 
the external file remains unchanged.

1. The user enters `addmod CS1010 10`, 
and the program adds the new module correspondingly. 
Since this is a valid command which modifies the data,
 the `Storage` object appends `addmod CS1010 10` to the external file.

1. The user enters `exit`, and the program terminates.

##### Subsequent Use
The same user starts the application again (on the same device as the first use).

1. `ModTracker` creates a new `Storage` object 
with the same specified file path at `data/modtracker.txt`.
   
1. The `Storage` object checks that the file at `data/modtracker.txt` exists,
and reads the first line of the file to obtain the user's name.

1. The `Storage` object passes the username to `ModTracker`, 
which calls `Ui` to greet the user.

1. `ModTracker` then obtains the remaining lines in the file via `Storage`,
and passes it to `Parser` to load the data into `ModuleList` and `TaskList`.

1. The program prompts the user for further inputs,
and it continues as per normal, with the data loaded.

The following sequence diagram shows how the storage feature works,
with a focus on how it obtains the username:

![Storage Sequence Diagram](diagrams/Storage%20Sequence%20Diagram.svg)
<br/> Figure 4. Sequence Diagram of Storage feature

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Saves the user input to the file
    * Pros: Easy to implement as code from `Parser` can be reused
    * Cons: Increases coupling as it depends on the `Parser` class 
    to make sense of the data
* **Alternative 2**: Parses input into a different format 
storing the different modules, time expected, time spent and tasks
    * Pros: Independent of how `Parser` takes in user input
    * Cons: Requires additional work to parse data into the required
    storage format


### 4.2 Add Module <a name="4.2"></a>

#### Current Implementation

The add module feature will implement the checks of the module code input by the user through the following operations:

`checkIfModuleValid()` – Checks if the module code starts with 2 - 3 characters, followed by 4 digits, followed by an 
                         optional character.

`checkIfModuleExist()` – Checks if the module already exists in the list of modules

If the module code is valid and does not exist, the add module feature will proceed to create the module and adds it to 
the list of modules.  

> **_NOTE:_**  A module is identfied by its module code

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `addmod CS2113T` command for the first time.  

![addmod](diagrams/addmod%20activity%20diagram.png)
<br/> Figure 5. Activity Diagram of Add Module feature


Given below is a detailed explanation on how the add module mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application for the first time and hence, the list of modules is empty. 
        The user types in a command: `addmod CS2113T`. 

1. The parser class makes sense of the user input and calls the `addMod()` function in ModuleList class.

1. Within the `addMod()` function, it will first check if the module code is valid by calling 
   `checkIfModuleValid()` function. The `checkIfModuleValid()` function will return true if the module code is 
   valid, and return false otherwise. If `checkIfModuleValid()` function returns true, proceed to step 4.

1. Within the addmod function, it will then check if the module already exists in the list of modules by 
   calling `checkIfModuleExist()` function. The `checkIfModuleExist()` function will return true if the module 
   already exists in the modlist, and false otherwise. If `checkIfModuleValid()` function returns true, 
   proceed to step 5.  

1. A new module with module code "CS2113T” is created by calling the constructor of Module class.

1. The newly created module is added to the list of modules.

1. The `printAdd()` function of the Ui class is called, displaying “CS2113T is added.” to the user.

1. The newly created module is saved to storage.  
  

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addmod CS2113T` command works.

![Addmodseq](diagrams/Addmodseq.png)  
<br/> Figure 6. Sequence Diagram of Add Module feature



#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: Checking existence of module by `checkIfModuleExist()` within `addmod()` function

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Checks that module does not exist in the list of modules before adding a new module
    * Pros: Ensure that there will be no duplicate modules in the list of modules
    * Cons: User cannot have 2 same modules in the list of modules.

* **Alternative 2**: Always add a new module
    * Pros: The user can have 2 same modules in the list of modules.
    * Cons: If the user had inputted 2 same modules and wants to add the workload for these modules, the current 
          application will only update the module that was inputted earlier, ignoring the second module, resulting in 
          inconsistency.
    * Cons: If the user does not want duplicate modules, the user must ensure he/she does not add a module that is 
          already in the list of modules.  
          
### 4.3 Add Time <a name="4.3"></a>
The add time feature edits the actual workload for a specific module as indicated by the user. 
This is done by adding time spent on the module. The actual workload is broken down into academic weeks and
hours spent in the respective academic weeks.

#### Current Implementation

The feature will implement the same checks as the add module feature as shown earlier.

The feature will also implement two additional checks namely:

`checkIfTimeValid` - checks if the time input is valid. For instance, the time input cannot have alphabets 
neither can it be too large.

`checkIfWeekValid` - checks if the week input is valid. For instance, the week input cannot be more than two
digits or contain alphabets.

`doesTimeExceed99` - checks if the time the user wishes to add will cause the total time to exceed 99 hours.

If the module code is valid and exists the add time feature will proceed to add time from the module
as indicated by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add time command behaves at each step.

> **_NOTE:_**  The first number is the hours spent in that week. The second number is the academic week that is being
>updated.
>

1. The user launches the application and does all required steps to add a module with module code `CS2113T`
to a list of modules. This is done by inputting the command `addmod CS2113T`.

1. The user now types in a command: `addtime CS2113T 2 4`. This calls the addtime command from `Parser`.
`Parser` then calls the `addTime()` method in `ModuleList` and passes `CS2113T`,`2` and `4` as parameters into the
method. 

1. Within the `addTime()` function, it will first check if the module code is valid by calling
`checkIfModuleValid()` function. If the module code is valid, the `checkIfModuleValid()` function will return true.

1. Within the `addTime()` function, it will check if the module exists in the module list storage by calling
`checkIfModuleExist()` function. If the module does exist, the `checkIfModuleExist()` function will return true.

1. Within the `addTime()` function, it will check if the time input is valid by calling
`checkIfTimeValid()` function. If the time input is valid, the `checkIfTimeValid()` function will return true.

1. Within the `addTime()` function, it will check if the week input is valid by calling
`checkIfWeekValid()` function. If the week input is valid, the `checkIfWeekValid()` function will return true.

1. Within the `addTime()` function, it will check if the hours the user wishes to add will cause the total time
to exceed 99 hours by 
calling the `doesTimeExceed99()` function. If the time does exceed 99, the `doesTimeExceed99()`
function will return true.

1. A time of `2` hours in academic week `4` is added to the actual workload of the `CS2113T` module. 

1. The system will print the output string `2 hours have been added to CS2113T`

1. The actual workload gets updated in storage.

The following sequence diagram illustrates what happens when a user executes `addTime CS2113T 2 4`.

![addTimeSeq](diagrams/AddTimeSeqDiagram.png)  
<br/> Figure 7. Sequence Diagram of Add Time feature

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: adding time with academic weeks associated in input
    * Pros: Easier to manage for user as user only needs to focus on the current academic week to track his workload
    * Cons: The user might prefer to manage his time spent in totality
* **Alternative 2**: adding time in totality (without indication of weeks)
    * Pros: Able to cumulatively add time and manage workload based on the overall total time spent.
    * Cons: May not be very useful to know total time spent as workload may be better managed weekly.


### 4.4 Minus Time <a name="4.4"></a>
The minus time feature edits the actual workload for a specific module as indicated by the user. 
This is done by removing time spent on the module. The actual workload is broken down into academic weeks and
hours spent in the respective academic weeks. This feature is the opposite of the add time feature. 

#### Current Implementation

The feature will implement the same checks as the add time feature as shown earlier in _section 4.3_.

As the command now is minus time, there would be two additional checks implemented.

`doesActualTimeExist()` - checks if the module code has existing actual workload stored to it.

`doesHoursExceedTotal()` - checks if the hours the user wishes to remove exceed the total hours in the actual workload.


If the module code is valid, exists and has an actual workload the minus time feature will proceed to minus
time from the module as indicated by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the minus time command behaves at each step.

> **_NOTE:_**  The first number is the hours spent in that week. The second number is the academic week that is being
>updated.
>

1. The user launches the application and does all the required steps to add a module with module code `CS2113T`
to a list of modules. This is done by input of the command `addmod CS2113T`.

1. The user then does all the required steps to add `2` hours of time spent in academic week `4` on `CS2113T`. This
is done by input of the command `addtime CS2113T 2 4`.

1. The user now types in a command: `minustime CS2113T 2 4`. This calls the minustime command from `Parser`.
`Parser` then calls the `minusTime()` method in `ModuleList` and passes `CS2113T`,`2` and `4` as parameters into the
method.

1. Within the `minusTime()` function, it will first check if the module code is valid by calling
`checkIfModuleValid()` function. If the module code is valid, `checkIfModuleValid()` function will return true.

1. Within the `minusTime()` function, it will check if the module exists in the module list storage by calling
`checkIfModuleExist()` function. If the module does exist, the `checkIfModuleExist()` function will return true.

1. Within the `minusTime()` function, it will also check if the time input is valid by calling
`checkIfTimeValid()` function. If the time input is valid, the `checkIfTimeValid()` function will return true.

1. Within the `minusTime()` function, it will subsequently check if the week input is valid by calling
`checkIfWeekValid()` function. If the week input is valid, the `checkIfWeekValid()` function will return true.

1. Within the `minusTime()` function, it will then check if there is an existing actual workload for this module by
calling the `doesActualTimeExist()` function. If the module has an existing workload, the `doesActualTimeExist()`
function will return true.

1. Within the `minusTime()` function, it will lastly check if the hours the user wish to remove is more than the
existing hours by
calling the `doesHoursExceedTotal()` function. If the module has an existing workload, the `doesHoursExceedTotal()`
function will return true.

1. A time of `2` hours in academic week `4` will be removed from the actual workload of the `CS2113T` module. 

1. The system will print the output string `2 hours have been removed from CS2113T`

1. The actual workload gets updated in storage.

The following sequence diagram illustrates what happens when a user executes `minusTime CS2113T 2 4`.

![minusTimeSeq](diagrams/minusTimeSeqDiagram.png)  
<br/> Figure 8. Sequence Diagram of Minus Time feature

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: removing time with academic weeks associated in input
    * Pros: Easier to manage for user as the user only needs to focus on the current academic week to track workload
    * Cons: User might prefer to manage time spent in totality
* **Alternative 2**: minus time in totality (without indication of weeks)
    * Pros: Able to cumulatively remove time and manage workload based on overall total time spent in all weeks.
    * Cons: May not be very useful to know total time spent as workload may be better managed weekly.
    
### 4.5 Edit Time <a name="4.5"></a>
The edit time feature edits the actual workload for a specific module as indicated by the user. 
This is done by replacing the time spent on the module. The actual workload is broken down into academic weeks and
hours spent in the respective academic weeks.
 
#### Current Implementation
 
The feature will implement the same checks as the add time module feature as shown earlier in _section 4.3_.
 
If the module code is valid and exists the edit time feature will proceed to edit the time from the module
as indicated by the user.
 
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit time command behaves at each step.
 
> **_NOTE:_**  The first number is the hours spent in that week. The second number is the academic week that is being
>updated.
>
 
1. The user launches the application and does all the required steps to add a module with module code `CS2113T`
to a list of modules. This is done by input of the command `addmod CS2113T`.
 
1. The user now types in a command: `edittime CS2113T 2 4`. This calls the edittime command from `Parser`.
`Parser` then calls the `editTime()` method in `ModuleList` and passes `CS2113T`,`2` and `4` as parameters into the
method. 
 
1. Within the `editTime()` function, it will first check if the module code is valid by calling
`checkIfModuleValid()` function. If the module code is valid, `checkIfModuleValid()` function will return true.
 
1. Within the `editTime()` function, it will subsequently check if the module exists in the module list storage by 
calling `checkIfModuleExist()` function. 
If the module does exist, the `checkIfModuleExist()` function will return true.

1. Within the `editTime()` function, it will next check if the time input is valid by calling
`checkIfTimeValid()` function. If the time input is valid, the `checkIfTimeValid()` function will return true.

1. Within the `editTime()` function, it will lastly check if the week input is valid by calling
`checkIfWeekValid()` function. If the week input is valid, the `checkIfWeekValid()` function will return true.
 
1. A time of `2` hours in academic week `4` will be the new actual workload of the `CS2113T` module. 
 
1. The system will print the output string 
 `2 hours have been added to CS2113T`
 `2 hours have been spent on this module in week 4`
 
1. The actual workload gets updated in storage.
 
#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: time input rounded off to 1 decimal place.
    * Pros: Easy to store and easier for user to view. Also provides consistency throughout the app.
    * Cons: User might prefer to manage his time spent more precisely with high number of decimal places
* **Alternative 2**: time input left unedited.
    * Pros: App takes in exactly what user inputted.
    * Cons: May not be easy to view the time when the actual time spent has too many decimal places.

### 4.6 View modules <a name="4.6"></a>

#### Current Implementation

The view module command allows the user to view all the modules taken,
the respective time spent and expected module workload at a glance. It prints 
`weekNumber`,`moduleCode`, `expectedWorkload` and `actualWorkload` in the specified 
week for all the modules taken in a table format. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view module command behaves at each step.

1. User calls the view module command from the `Parser`. `Parser` then calls the `printTable()`
method in `Ui`. `printTable()` then instantiates `ModView` class and calls the `printAllModuleInformation()`
method from the `ModView` class.

1. User input is subjected to `validateInputs()` to verify that 
both of the following conditions are satisfied.
  * `weekNumber` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive.
  * `modlist` in `list` is not empty.

If any of the above conditions is not satisfied, an error message will be printed
and `printAllModuleInformation()` terminates.

1. A method `getMaxModuleLength()` will be called to find out the maximum length 
of module code of modules taken. This is to facilitate the resizing of the printed table.

1. `updateTemplates()` then updates the table templates such as `border`, `header` 
and `contents` are updated accordingly based on the output of `getMaxModuleLength()`.

1. For each `Module` in `modList`, `updateContent()` will be called to update the contents
to be printed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view module command works. 

![view-module](diagrams/ModViewSequence.png)
<br/> Figure 9. Sequence Diagram of View Module feature



### 4.7 Breakdown and Analysis <a name="4.7"></a>

#### Current Implementation

The analysis command allows the user to view the breakdown of the total time spent
in the week across all modules and provides a simple analysis of how they are doing.

1. User calls the view module command from the `Parser`. `Parser` then calls the `printBreakdownAnalysis()`
   method in `Ui`. `printBreakdownAnalysis()` then instantiates `ViewTimeBreakdownAnalysis` class. 
   and calls the `printTimeBreakdownAndAnalysis()` method. 
   
1. The user input is subjected to `validateInputs()` to verify that 
   both of the following conditions are satisfied.
     * `weekNumber` is an integer between 1 and 13 inclusive.
     * `modlist` in `list` is not empty.
   
   If any of the above conditions is not satisfied, an error message will be printed
   and `printTimeBreakdownAndAnalysis()` terminates.

1. `printTime()` method in `printTimeBreakdownAndAnalysis()` is first called. For each `Module` 
in `modList`, `printTime()` prints `actualWorkload` and `expectedWorkload` in form of a 
horizontal bar graph. The existence of the desired data is checked using `doesActualTimeExist()` 
and `doesExpectedTimeExist()` methods of the `Module` class. If the desired data does not exist, a `NO INPUT` will be printed. 

1. `printBreakdown()` then calculates the total time spent by the user on the modules taken in the specified 
week. It then prints out `actualTime` of each `Module` as a percentage of `totalTimeSpent`. If there is no input, 
a `NO INPUT` message will be printed. `printBreakdown()` return **TRUE** if there exists a `Module` that has a 
valid input, else **False** is returned.

1. If output of `printBreakdown()` is `True`, `printAnalysis()` will be called. `computeAnalysisOfTimeSpent()` 
is called to determine the outcome of the analysis. A message will be printed depending on the output
of the analysis. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the analysis command works. 

![analysis](diagrams/AnalysisSequence.png)
<br/> Figure 10. Sequence Diagram of Analysis feature


#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Printing data as a bar graph
    * Pros: Easy implementation as the bar graph is printed as a `String`.
    * Cons: It might be difficult to compare across modules using a bar graph.
* **Alternative 2**: Printing data as a line graph
    * Pros: Easier to compare across different modules.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement as it requires external libraries.
    * Cons: Difficult to test due to additional dependencies on external libraries. 

### 4.8 Add Task <a name="4.8"></a>
The add task feature allows user to add a task under an existing module. 

#### Current Implementation
The `addtask` command is executed by the `parse` method in the `Parser` class, which then calls the `addTask` method 
in the `TaskList` class. The `addTask` method performs all the necessary logic for the add task feature.

Given below is an example usage scenario.
1. The user input the `addtask` command and the `parse` method in `Parser` parses the command.
1. `parse` calls the `addTask` method in `TaskList`.
1. The `addTask` method splits the user input into 3 sections:
    * `Section 1`: command
    * `Section 2`: module code
    * `Section 3`: task description
1. The `addTask` method calls the `checkIfModuleValid` method in `ModuleList` class to check if `Section 2` is a 
valid module code.
    * If module code is not valid, the `addTask` method will return and `Ui` will prompt the user to enter a 
    valid module code.
    * Else if module code is valid, the `addTask` method will execute the next step.
1. The `addTask` method calls the `checkIfModuleExist` method to check if `Secion 2` (module code) exists in the database.
    * If module code does not exist in the database, the `addTask` method will return and `Ui` will prompt the user to
    execute the `addmod` or `addexp` command first.
    * Else if module code exists, the `addTask` method will execute the next step.
1. The `addTask` method will create a new `Task` object by the constructor in `Task` class, with `Section 3` (task description). 
1. The `addTask` method adds the `Task` object to the array list `tasks`.

#### Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: If module does not exist in module list, do not add the task.
    * Pros: Able to let users know that the module does not exist in the module list, hence preventing the situation where
    users type in a module code wrongly and the task is added under that wrong module.
    * Cons: May be slightly inconvenient as user will need to add a module first before adding the tasks related to that module.
    
* **Alternative 2**: If module does not exist in the module list, automatically add the module, then add the task.
    * Pros: Slightly more convenient as user can add a new module and task at the same time.
    * Cons: May cause confusion and inconvenience if users type in a module code wrongly, and the module 
    is automatically added to the module list.
    
#### Future Implementation
A future implementation requires user to enter the expected time required to complete the task, and the week number. The `addTask` method will split the 
user input into 5 sections, with `Section 4` as the expected time required to complete the task and `Section 5` as the week number. `Section 4`
and `Section 5` will then be used in the future implementation of mark task as done feature, as further illustrated in the [mark task as done](#4.9)
section.

### 4.9 Mark Task as Done <a name="4.9"></a>
The mark task as done feature allows user to mark an existing task as done.

#### Current Implementation
The `done` command is executed by the `parse` method in the `Parser` class, which then calls the `setDone` method in the
`TaskList` class. The `setDone` method performs all the necessary logic for the mark task as done feature.

Given below is an example usage scenario.
1. The user input the `done` command and the `parse` method in `Parser` parses the command.
1. `parse` calls the `setDone` method in `TaskList`.
1. The `setDone` method splits the user input into 2 sections:
    * `Section 1`: command
    * `Section 2`: task number corresponding to the index of `Task` object in array list `tasks`
1. The `setDone` method will check if the array list `tasks` is empty.
    * If array list is empty, `Ui` will notify the user that there is no `Task` to mark as done.
    * Else if array list is not empty, `setDone` method will execute the next step.
1. The `setDone` method will check the validity of `Section 2` (task number).
    * If task number is not an integer, an exception will be thrown and the `setDone` method terminates.
    * If task number is out of bounds, `Ui` will prompt the user to enter a valid task number.
    * Else if task number is valid, `setDone` method will execute the next step.
1. The `setDone` method will then call the `setAsDone` method in `Task` class to mark the `Task` corresponding to 
`Section 2` (task number) as done.

<br/> Figure 12. Sequence Diagram of Complete Task feature

#### Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use `X` and `/` as cross and tick to indicate whether a task is marked as done. 
    * Pros: Easy to implement and works in all systems without the need for special configurations.
    * Cons: Does not look as nice.
    
* **Alternative 2**: Use actual unicode symbols as cross and tick to indicate whether a task is marked as done.
    * Pros: Looks nicer.
    * Cons: Harder to implement and may not work in all systems.
   
#### Future Implementation
1. When the `Task` is set as done, the `setDone` method will call the `addTime` method in `ModuleList` class
to add the expected time required to complete the task to the actual time spent on the module.
    * This future implementation requires `Section 4` (expected time required to complete the task) and
    `Section 5` (week number) from the future implementation of the `addTask` method to be passed as a parameter to the `setDone` method and then to the 
    `addTime` method.
