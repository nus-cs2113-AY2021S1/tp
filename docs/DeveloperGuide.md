## Design & implementation

### Architecture


![Architecture](diagrams/Architecture.png)


The Architecture Diagram above gives an overview of how different components interacts 
with each other in the app. 

As the app starts, the main program initialises the Ui, Logic and Storage components.
Then, the Storage component reads existing data file if it is available, else a fresh copy of 
data file is created.The storage component also reads the .ics file that has the user's timetable and
if it exists imports all the tasks into the TaskMap object. If it does not exist then a warning error
is given. 
This step also initialises the content of runtime storage which is store 
in a TaskMap object.

Now the Ui component is ready to take inputs from the User, and the input is processed and executed
in the Logic component, the execution result is passed back to Ui component and displayed to the User.
Just before the main program exits, Storage component saves the content in the TaskMap to the data file.

Commons provide utility functions and messages to be used by other components.

The sequence diagrams below shows a typical workflow the program.


![LoadAndSaveTasks](diagrams/Startup.png)


At the start of the app, tasks are loaded using loadTasks function from Storage class, 
and writeTasksToFile function is called when the program stops. 
Also at the 

![ComponentsSeq](diagrams/ComponentsSeq.png)


In the example above, after the programs starts, User inputs "add meeting",
the input is captured by the Ui component, then it calls the processRaw 
function from the Logic component, to extract useful information from the input. 
Logic component verified the command is valid and calls the addTask function 
from the TaskMap, then TaskMap carries out the operation, and a message is
return to the Ui from the Logic component.

The next input provide by the User is "bye", it follows a similar process.
After the message is shown to the User, the main program calls the
writeTasksToFile() function in Storage and saves the data.


### Ui component


![UiComponent](diagrams/UiClass.png)


The diagram above is a class diagram of the Ui component.
Other than the usual InputStream and OutputStream, the Ui component has a
DisplayDateStructure. This abstract class prepares the content to be 
printed when the DisplayMode is DAY, WEEK or MONTH. The content is generated
using generateContent function, which writes the intended content into
the 2-D array of characters for weekly and monthly view. After that, 
the array will be shown to the user by Ui class via the OutputStream. 

Moreover, DayStructure, WeekStructure and MonthStructure extends the DisplayDateStructure.
DayStructure generate content in table format while the other two class will generate 
a different size of the 2-D array mentioned in the previous paragraph 
due the difference in number of days displayed.

### Logic component


![LogicComponent](diagrams/LogicClass.png)


From the Ui component, the raw input from the User is passed to the Parser class.
Parser class will process and validate the input, then it generates a specific
command accordingly.  Specific commands extends from the abstract Command class.
Command operates on the TaskMap and execution of Command generates a 
CommandResult. This CommandResult is passed back to the Ui component and 
respective content will be displayed to User based on the CommandResult. 

### Model component


![ModelComponent](diagrams/TaskMapClass.png)


Task class consists of attributes like description, date, start time, end time,
priority, and reminder that are important to users. Whereas other attributes like 
HASH_VALUE_DIGITS, taskID and internal values of Priority enum class matters
more to developers. For example, the HASH_VALUE_DIGITS and the color code of 
Priority could affect the content displayed to User, and the reason why the
constant 4 is used will be explained in the next paragraph. 

TaskMap is the container used for runtime storage, it stores up to 10000 Task
objects. The number 10000 is chosen such that the unique identifier of each
Task is kept within 4 digits. Keeping it to 4 digits allows the app to have a
better displaying effect.

The underlying data structure used for TaskMap is the Java LinkedHashMap.
It is chosen because it allows efficient access to an element (Task) using the
unique identifier (Integer). Another reason of using LinkedHashMap is because 
it is ordered, this allows the container to be sorted. DateSorter and 
PrioritySorter implements the Task comparator, they are used in the TaskMap
functions sortListByDate() and sortListByPriority().

Reminder is a class that consists of a class of timer and localtime, as each 
reminder needs to have its own timer. The timer is created when a reminder 
is started, and cancelled when the reminder is turned off. As such, having
individual timers for each task is important so that they will not interfere
with one another.


### Storage component


![StorageComponent](diagrams/StorageClass.png)


At the initiating and closing stage of the program, the Storage component
will read and write to the data file respectively. As shown in the diagram
above, the data file is named as "data.json" and placed under a folder called
"data". The Storage component also uses the Google Gson library to convert Task
object to and from json format. For example, in the process of saving to file,
each Task object is convert to json string and then writes to file via FileWriter. 


### Common classes

Common classes provide utility functions and string messages used by multiple components,
and these classes are stored in the seedu.commons package.


## Product scope

## Glossary

    - JSON: (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, and a standard text-based format 
            used for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.
    
    - LinkedHashMap: is a Hash table and linked list implementation of the Map interface, with predictable  
                     iteration order. This implementation differs from HashMap in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running  
                     through all of its entries.

    Expected: Task with the index of 3542 is deleted from the list. 

    - Test case: delete 12378  
    Expected: No task is deleted, and an Invalid index error is shown.

### Editing a task

Prerequisites: Add some tasks to the list. List all tasks using the list command.
All indexes are less than or equal to four-digit numbers.

1. Editing the description of a task

    - Test case: edit 3542 des/homework   
    Expected: The task with index 3542 will have its description changed to “homework” 
    while the other components will remain the same.
