## 2. Design - Wamika

This section describes the design and implementation of the product. It has been divided into two sections: Architecture 
and Implementation. 

### 2.1. Architecture

The architecture diagram given in the figure below explains the high-level design of the App. 

![Architecture Diagram](DG_Diagrams/Architecture/Architecture.png)

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` is the class Duke.java. It is responsible for:

- Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and calling or creating objects in the order of execution.

The rest of the App consists of 4 main components:

- `Ui` : The Ui component handles all interactions with the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- `Logic` : The Logic component makes sense of the command and executes it.
- `Model` : The Model component is responsible for all data held in the memory.
- `Storage` : The Storage component handles data by reading from and writing to files in the hard disk. 

The sections below give more details of each component.

#### 2.1.1 Ui Component
The Ui component is responsible for getting the user input and for displaying appropriate messages as response 
to commands executed by the logic component. The following class diagram gives a brief overview of the Ui component 
and it's interaction with other components.

![uicomponent](DG_Diagrams/Components/UiComponent.png)

#### 2.1.2. Logic Component
The Logic component is responsible for the following tasks:
- Makes sense of the command entered by the user by splitting it into the command type and the parameters and/or 
delimiters if any.
- Executes a command based on its type and provides an appropriate result to the user via the Ui component.

The following class diagram briefly explains how different classes in the Logic component interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

> Note: ABCFavCommand represents the different fav command classes.
> PQRCommand represents the different dine command classes.
> XYZCommand represents the different route command classes.
> The actual class names are written in the notes beside the classes.

<img src="DG_Diagrams/Components/LogicComponent.png" alt="logiccomponent" width=1400>

#### 2.1.3. Model Component
The Model component is responsible for the following tasks:
- Stores the bus data, dine info data and favourites list in memory.
- Performs operations on the data to facilitate the command execution by Logic component.

The following class diagram briefly explains how different classes in the Model component interact with each other.

![modelcomponent](DG_Diagrams/Components/ModelComponent.png)

#### 2.1.4. Storage Component
The Storage component is responsible for the following tasks:
- Stores the favourite commands in a file in a certain format and retrieves this information everytime 
the user enters the application.
- Stores the number of times each bus stop has been typed by the user since he/she started using the application and 
retrieves it everytime the user enters the application.
    + This information is used to find out the user's most frequently searched location so far and display it to the 
    user. 
- These files are updated after every execution of a user command.

The following class diagram briefly explains how different classes in the Storage component interact with each other.

![StorageComponent](DG_Diagrams/Components/StorageComponent.png)

## 3. Implementation
This section provides details of how the main features of Nav@NUS have been implemented.

### 3.1. Finding a direct route (`/route` Feature) - Wamika
`/route <location1> /to <location2>` is the command that has to entered by the user to 
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
see all direct bus routes available from **location1** to **location2**.

The class diagram in the figure below shows how different classes used for implementation of the `/route` command 
are linked to each other. <br>
<img src="DG_Diagrams/RouteCommand/RouteCommandClass.png" alt="RouteCommandClass" width = 800>

The `RouteCommand#executeCommand()` method of RouteCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Calls `RouteParser#getLocations()` to get the locations entered by the user in the order of starting location and 
destination.
    - The `RouteParser#getLocations()` method throws an exception if the locations or the delimiter `/to` is missing.
2. Calls `RouteCommand#checkLocations()` to make sure location strings are not empty or the same.
    - The `RouteCommand#checkLocation()` method throws an exception if locations are empty or the same.
3. Calls `RouteCommand#similarityCheck()` to check if the locations are not in the list of bus stops but 
are similar.
    - The `RouteCommand#similarityCheck()` method calls the static `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` method and returns 
    a list of similar locations, if any.
    - If the list of similar locations is empty, `RouteCommand#executeCommand()` performs step 4 given below, 
    else it calls the static method, `Ui#printPossibleLocsMessage()`, to print the list of similar locations. 
4. Calls static `BusData#possibleBuses()` to get a list of buses with their routes from the starting location to 
the destination.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

   - `BusData#possibleBuses()` calls `Bus#getPossibleRoute()` to check for a possible route for the given bus number.
   - `BusData#possibleBuses()` repeats this call for all bus numbers.

The following sequence diagram explains the above steps when the user enters `/route loc1 /to loc2`.

<img src="DG_Diagrams/RouteCommand/RouteCommand.png" alt="Executing" width = 850>

The following sequence diagrams explain the interactions omitted in the main diagram.
<img src="DG_Diagrams/RouteCommand/RouteCommandInternal.png" alt="executing command" width = 700>

<img src="DG_Diagrams/RouteCommand/BusData.png" alt="bus data" width = 600>

**Design Considerations**

The main aim here is to find if the starting location and destination exist in a particular list of bus stops in 
that order.

**_Aspect: How bus data should be stored and retrieved._**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each bus is an object that contains the bus number and full route as an ArrayList.
    + _Pros:_ Makes it easier to integrate with other functions of the app such as displaying bus route of a particular 
    bus.  
    + _Cons:_ Each bus number's route has to be scanned to check for the starting location and destination in that order.
     
* **Alternative 2:** Each location is an object that contains the location name and an ArrayList of bus objects. Each
bus object contains the list of remaining stops in the route of that bus.
    + _Pros:_ It is easier and somewhat faster to find the buses that go from the starting location to the destination as 
    the data itself has filtered out the buses that stop at the starting location.
    + _Cons:_ A lot of duplicate data is stored since each bus stop will have a list of the remaining route for every bus 
    that stops there. 
    
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given the above alternatives, alternative 1 was used considering the implementation of other features of the 
application.

### 3.2. Full Route Display (`/routemap` Feature) - Johnson

The `/routemap <bus code>` is the command that has to entered by the user to see the full bus route of a user-specified
bus route.

The class diagram in the figure below shows how different classes used for implementation of the `/routemap` command 
are linked to each other.

![RouteCommandClass](DG_Diagrams/RouteMapCommand/RouteMapCommand.png)

The `RouteMapCommand#executeCommand()` method of RouteMapCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Calls `RouteMapCommand#selectAndPrintBusRoute()`to attempt to retrieve user-specified bus code. (Bus code is stored
as a string variable in the command)

2. Calls `RouteMapCommand#checkBusCode()` to make sure bus code entered by the user is not empty or a white-space.

3. Calls static `BusData#selectBus()` to find the user-specified bus in the bus data list. If found, the Bus object will be 
returned. Else, null is returned.

4. Calls `Ui#printFullRoute()` to display full route of the specified bus.<br>

The following sequence diagram explains the above steps when the user enters `/routemap busCode`.<br>
![Overview](DG_Diagrams/RouteMapCommand/RouteMapCommandOverallSeq.png)<br>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following sequence diagrams explain the interactions for bus route retrieval.<br>
![Internal](DG_Diagrams/RouteMapCommand/RouteMapCommandSeq.png)

**Design Considerations**

**_Aspect: Retrieval of bus routes_**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each bus is an object that contains the bus number and full route as an ArrayList
of busStops objects.
    + _Pros:_ It is easy to maintain and updating of bus stops and bus codes are easier to implement.
    + _Cons:_ Has to loop through the array of bus stops and obtain their individual bus description.
     
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* **Alternative 2:** The full route of each bus is stored in a string format and is directly accessed.
    + _Pros:_ It is easier and quicker to print out the full route of a user-specified bus.
    + _Cons:_ Alot of manual work is needed if the bus route/ bus stop is updated. It is not scalable for large-scale 
    projects.
    
Given the above alternatives, alternative 1 was used considering the scalability of the application.

### 3.3. Bus at bus stop finder (`/bus` Feature) - Wong Heng Chin

`/bus <bus stop>` is the command to execute to see buses which stop at a specific bus stop.<br>

The command is executed in the following steps:
1. The user calls `Parser#setUserInput(<UserInput>)` by entering the command `/bus <bus stop>`. The new user input is updated.
2. `Parser#extractType()` is called to instantiate `BusCommand` and run the user command.
3. `BusCommand#similarLocations()` is self invoked and calls `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` which returns an arraylist of possible location.
4. `BusCommand#setBusStop()` is self invoked in which, if `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` returns an empty array list, `BusStops#findBusStop()` is called.
    - If `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` returns non-empty array list, `Ui#printPossibleLocsMessage()` is called and an exception is thrown.
    - If `BusStops#findBusStop()` returns null, an exception is thrown.
5. `BusCommand#executeCommand()` is called.
6. `BusData#getBusAtStop()` is called and returns an array list of buses.
7. `BusData#printBusAtBusStop()` is called to print array list of buses.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/bus` command.

### 3.4. List All stops (`/liststops` Feature) - Yuxin
`/liststops` is the command which prints all bus stops declared in the BusStops enum.

The `ListStopsCommand#executeCommand()` method of ListStopsCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Calls `BusStops#listStops()` to print out all stops.
    - The `BusStops#listStops()` method iterate through all bus stops declared in the BusStops enum class.
    - Close names for bus stops will also be printed if it has one.
    
The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/liststops` command. <br>
<img src="DG_Diagrams/ListStopsSequence.png" alt="list stops" width=500>

**Design Considerations**

**_Aspect: Close names of bus stops_**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Close names are only mentioned but not implemented for users to use in other functions.
    + _Pros:_ It is easy to implement and there will be no bugs since it only uses the print function.
    + _Cons:_ Inconvenient for users as they have to re-enter the command using the full name of the bus stop.
     
* **Alternative 2:** Able to use close names in other functions.
    + _Pros:_ It is quicker and more convenient for the user as they can run commands using close names they prefer.
    + _Cons:_ It is very time-consuming to implement and can lead to many bugs.
    
Given the above alternatives, alternative 1 was used considering the integration of other commands.

### 3.5. Dining options finder (`/dine` Feature) - Shuyi

`/dine <faculty>` is the command that has to be entered by the user to see all the dining options available in the 
specified faculty.

The `DineCommand#executeCommand()` method of DineCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Checks the user input and throws an exception if the input is empty.
2. Calls `DineCommand#checkFaculty()` method to check for a match between the data and user input.
    + Sets the `isFound` parameter to **true** if there is any match.
        + Calls `Ui#printDineResult()` method to print the matching results.
    + Sets the `isFound` parameter to **false** if there is no match.
        + Throws an exception if `isFound` is false.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/dine` command.<br>
<img src="DG_Diagrams/DineSequence.png" alt="dine" width=450>

### 3.6. Find specific dining outlets (`/dineinfo` Feature) - Shuyi

`/dineinfo <outlet>` is the command that has to be entered by the user to see information of a specified dining outlet.

The `DineInfoCommand#executeCommand()` method of DineInfoCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Checks the user input and throws an exception if the input is empty.
2. Calls `DineInfoCommand#checkFoodPlace()` method to check for a match between the data and user input.
    + Adds any matching data to an ArrayList `searchList`.
    + Throws an exception if `searchList` is empty.
    + Calls `Ui#printDineInfoResult()` method to print the data in `searchList` if it is not empty.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/dineinfo` command. <br>

### 3.7. Favourite command adder (`/addfav` Feature) - Yuxin

`/addfav <description>` is the command that has to be entered by the user to add a previous valid command in to the user's 
list of favourites.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `AddFavCommand#executeCommand()` method of AddFavCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. The `AddFavCommand#executeCommand` method throws an exception if the command to be saved in FavList is missing.
2. Calls `AddFavCommand#createFav()` to make a new Fav object to be saved in the FavList.
    - The `AddFavCommand#createFav()` method creates a Fav object with its command saved as its description if 
    the user left description empty.
3. Calls `AddFavCommand#addToFavList()` method to add the Fav object created to the Favlist.
    - The `AddFavCommand#createFav()` method calls the contains method within Favlist to check for any duplicate
    Fav objects within the list that contains the same command.
    - If the there are no duplicate Fav objects, Fav object created will be added to the FavList.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.8. Removing specific delete command (`/deletefav` Feature) - Johnson
`/deletefav <index>` is the command to remove a favourite command in the user's list of favourite commands. It allows the
user to customise the list of favourite commands to the user's liking.

The DeleteFavCommand#executeCommand() method of DeleteFavCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. `Parser#extractType()` is called to instantiate `DeleteFavCommand`. During instantiation, if the user specified
index is empty or blank, an exception would be thrown.
2. `Ui#printDeleteFavMessage(<index>)` is called to inform the user that the favourite command corresponding to the
index has been deleted.
3. `FavList#deleteFav(<index>)` is executed to remove the favourite command from the list of favourite commands.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/deletefav` command.

### 3.9. Favourite command executor (`/execfav` Feature) - Wong Heng Chin
`/execfav <index>` is the command to execute a command with the specific index in the list of favourite commands. <br>

The command is executed in the following steps:
1. The user calls `Parser#setUserInput(<UserInput>)` by entering the command `/execfav <index>`. The new user input is updated.
2. `Parser#extractType()` is called to instantiate `ExecFavCommand` and run the user command.
3. `ExecFavParser` is instantiated and `ExecFavParser#setIndex()` is called to parse the `<index>` input from the user.
    - `ExecFavParser#setIndex()` method throws an exception if `<index>` cannot be parsed into an integer or if it is blank.
4. `ExecFavCommand#executeCommand()` is called.
5. `ExecFavCommand#getFav()` is self invoked to obtain the required `Fav` object from `FavList`.
    - An exception is thrown if there is no `Fav` object in the specified index in `FavList`.
6. A new `Parser` object is instantiated to run the command in the `Fav` object.
    - If the command from the Fav object throws an exception when running, the exception will be caught in `ExecFavCommand#executeCommand()` and the `Fav` object will be deleted from the `FavList`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/execfav` command.
![ExecFav_Sequence_Diagram](DG_Diagrams/ExecFavCommand/ExecFavCommand.png)

**Design Considerations**

**_Aspect: Choice of command object in FavList to execute_**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Choosing command by index in list.
    + _Implementation:_ Easy to implement as `Fav` object can be extracted directly through index in `FavList`
    + _Bugs handling:_ Bugs for the first approach are easier to handle and limited. As all `Fav` objects in `FavList` have a unique index, the only bug to check for is whether the `<index>` keyed in by the user can be converted into an integer and whether the index is larger than the size of `FavList`.
    + _User experience:_ Command to execute fav object will be shorter.
* **Alternative 2:** Choosing command by description in list.
    + _Implementation:_ Implementation is more difficult as the description of all the `Fav` objects in the `FavList` will have to be scanned through and compared with the required description. This may adversely affect processing time as well.
    + _Bugs handling:_ Handling of bugs is more difficult as the description of `Fav` objects in the `FavList` are not unique. This causes extra complications to allow users to be able to choose which command to execute amongst those with duplicate descriptions instead of executing the wrong command.
    + _User experience:_ Command to execute fav object will be longer.
    
Therefore, choosing commands based on index (alternative 1) is easier to implement, more efficient, reduces possible bugs encountered and provides better user experience.

### 3.10. Modifying the description of a favourite command (`/descfav` Feature) - Wamika
`/descfav <index> /to <newDescription>` command allows the user to change the current description of their favourite command
at location **index** in the list to **newDescription**.

>Note: **index** is the index of the item in the list when the first number is indexed as 1. As a result, 
>we access this element in the ArrayList using **index** - 1.

The class diagram in the figure below shows how different classes used for implementation of the `/descfav` command 
are linked to each other. 

<img src="DG_Diagrams/DescFavCommand/descFavClass.png" alt="DescFav class diagram" width = 700>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `DescFavCommand#executeCommand()` method of DescFavCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1. Calls `DescFavParser#parseInput()` to check if the command message input by the user is valid.
    - Throws an exception if 
        + the input is empty.
        + the delimiter `/to` is missing.
    - Calls `Parser#splitCommands()` to separate the **index** and **description**.
    - Checks the validity of each parameter and throws an exception if 
        + both or either of the parameters have only spaces.
        + the given index is not a number.
    - If both inputs are valid, it assigns the input values to index and description variables.
2. Calls `DescFavParser#getIndex()` and `DescFavParser#getDescription()` to get the appropriate values input by the user.
3. Calls static `FavList#changeDesc()` to change the description of favourite at **index**.
    - Calls static `FavList#checkIndexAndDesc()` which throws an exception if **index** is out of bounds or if 
    **description** is the same as the previous description of this favourite.
    - Calls `Fav#changeDesc()` to update the old description to **description**.
    
The following sequence diagram explains the above steps when the user enters `/descfav 1 /to hello`.

The following sequence diagram explains the interactions omitted in the main diagram.

<img src="DG_Diagrams/DescFavCommand/descFavInternal.png" alt="executing command" width=700>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Design Considerations**

The main aim here is to change the description of a particular command in the list of favourites.

**_Aspect: How index and description are verified._**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Perform checks on the validity of index and description at intermediate steps
    + _Pros:_ The checks specific to `FavList` and `Fav` will be performed in those classes and all these methods 
    will be called in the main `DescFavCommand#executeCommand()` thus reducing coupling.
    + _Cons:_ It requires more methods to be written for any particular class.
    
* **Alternative 2:** Use the `DescFavParser` class to determine if the index is within bounds of the list and 
the description is different from what is already stored.
    + _Pros:_ It is quicker to determine that the command is invalid.
    + _Cons:_ Requires calling functions from `FavList` and `Fav` in the parser which would increase coupling.
    
While alternative 2 would place all checks in one place, it can be tedious to test or debug. Therefore, alternative 1 
was chosen. It also made the code look neater and more readable. 

### 3.11. Performing similarity checks - Wamika
This feature provides the user with suggestions for possible spelling errors, if any. It does not require any explicit 
instruction or command from the user and runs every time the user enters a `/route` or `/bus` command.<br>
The following steps explain how the similarity checks are performed.
* Once the location(s) entered by the user are retrieved, the `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` method is called for each 
location.
* `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` retrieves the list of bus stops and for each bus stop name, calls the 
`SimilarityCheck#getSimilarity()` method.
    + `SimilarityCheck#getSimilarity()` finds the location name with longer length and calculates Levenshtein distance
    between the two names using `SimilarityCheck#editDistance()`.
    + This distance is then divided by the longer distance to get a number between 0 and 1.
    + This number is subtracted from 1 to get the ratio of similarity.
* `SimilarityCheck#similarLoc()` adds the bus stop name to the list of possible locations if this similarity is greater 
than a certain threshold (taken as 0.60).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.12 Displaying most searched bus stop on start-up - Johnson

This feature informs the user about their most searched bus stop.
There is no function to explicitly call it and is executed only during Nav@NUS's start up.

The following steps explain how the search frequencies of each bus are updated.
1. Whenever the user enters a valid command (`/route` or `/bus`) that requires bus stops, `BusStops#findBusStop()` is 
called to locate the specified bus stop.
2. `BusStops#incrementSearchCount()` is called to increase the search count of the bus stop.

The following steps explain how the most searched bus stop is displayed.

1. On start-up, `Ui#printWelcomeMessage()` is called. <br>
2. `Ui#printMostSearchedBusStop()` is called to retrieve the most searched bus stop and display it.
3. `BusData#mostSearchedBusStop()`is called to identify the first instance of the bus stop with the highest search frequency.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program on start-up.

**Design Considerations**

**_Aspect: Implementing search frequencies_**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each value in the BusStops enumeration has a private integer
variable called searchCount.
    + _Pros:_ It is easier to maintain and updating of bus stops are easier to implement. It provides a template to be
    used for locations with many bus stops.
    + _Cons:_ Has to loop through the array of bus stops and obtain their respective search counts.
     
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* **Alternative 2:** The search frequency of each bus stop is stored in an array of tuple and is directly accessed.
    + _Pros:_ It is easier and quicker to obtain the most searched bus stop.
    + _Cons:_ It does not blend in well with other features that accesses the BusStops class.
    
Given the above alternatives, alternative 1 was used considering the integration of other commands.

### 3.13 Resetting search frequencies of bus stops (`/reset` Feature) - Johnson
This feature allows the user to reset the search frequencies of all bus stops.

The `ResetSearchFreqCommand#executeCommand()` method of ResetSearchFreqCommand Class executes the command in the following steps:
1.`BusStops#resetSearchFrequency()` is called to re-initialise all search counts of respective bus stops to zero.
2. `Ui#printResetSearchFreqMessage()` is called to inform the user that all search counts have been reset.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken by the program when the user calls the `/reset` command.
