## Introduction
Welcome to Study It Developer Guide!

This document details the architecture of Study It. It aims to provide an overview of the high-level system 
architecture and design of the app. It will also break down the design of the app into smaller components and be 
explained in detail. This will allow the readers to understand the architecture and design flow of Study It and 
how it operates.

Study It is an interactive desktop app that helps NUS students manage their study related matters especially during 
this online study environment. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). It can keep track of the 
student’s various study matters, present them in an organized and thoughtful manner to help them organize their 
study life. It will also provide various functionalities to help with their studies. 

The 4 main functionalities available now are bookmark, timetable, academic tracker and flashcard. 
Each of this will be discussed in detail under the “Design & Implementation” section later in the document.

## Design & implementation
This section explains the architecture of our software and the design of each component.

### Major components
This section introduces the multiple components in Study It.

![](Images/ArchitectureDiagrams/components.png)

Study It contains 4 major functional components which are the 
bookmark, timetable, academic and flashcard. Each of these component
provide different functionalities, and they combine to form our software -- Study It.

Component | What it does
----------|----------------
Bookmark  | Stores internet links under different categories for easier access
Timetable | Tracks and display your weekly schedule
Academic  | Stores important contacts and keep track of your grades
Flashcard | Stores study questions and allow you to quiz yourself for easier memorization

The **main component** of Study It helps user access each of these components.
It processes the user input, provides general functionalities to traverse the software and other
helpful functionalities. This will be further explained under Study It's design later.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Architecture
This section describes the overall architecture of Study It.

![Architecture Diagram](Images/ArchitectureDiagrams/architecture.png)

The *Architecture Diagram* given above explains the high-level design of the software.
Each component in the diagram will be briefly explained below.

The **`main`** in **`Study It`** is responsible for initializing all the other components
in the software.

The following is a brief overview of the components in Study It:
* **UI**: Handles the communication between the software and the user
* **Parser**: Processes the input from the user
* **Execution**: Perform the actions determined by the parser

The following components processes their respective actions (parsing and execution) and handles their own
storage component: 
* **Bookmark**
* **Timetable**
* **Academic**
* **Flashcard**

**General commands** are commands that takes priority in execution no matter which mode the software is currently
in.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Modes of the program**

Study It has 5 **modes** that the user can navigate between:
* **Main menu**: Default mode when booting the software, there are no functionalities tied to this mode
* **Bookmark**
* **Timetable**
* **Academic**
* **Flashcard**

Each of these modes has their own unique commands. The user must switch to that mode to perform the
mode's functionalities.

User can switch between these modes at any point when using the software.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions within the software when command is received from the user

![Sequence Overview](Images/ArchitectureDiagrams/overviewsequence.png)

As shown in the sequence diagram above, the user will interact with Study It via the User Interface (UI).
The commands received will then be parsed to identify the type of command. If the command is one of the 
general commands, it'll be processed and provide output. Otherwise, the command will be relayed
to different components to be processed based on the software's current mode. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Main Component

This section will give an overview of the main component of Study It.

The following class diagram shows the components related to the main Study It component and their respective
details.

![Main Component Diagram](Images/MainComponentDiagrams/maincomponent.png)

The main class being run for the program is contained under `StudyIt` class. 
As there are multiple modes of our app (main menu/bookmark/timetable/academic/flashcard), 
the Mode enumeration and a private static currentMode of Mode type is introduced to monitor the current 
operating mode of StudyIt. This is to allow the program to respond to different commands under different modes.

Each command input by the user will be processed by CommandParser class to determine the command type. 
This information, along with the original command string will be passed into Command class and executed under 
executeCommand(). If it is one of the general commands, it will be processed by that class. 
If it isn’t, the Command class will detect the current mode of the program and run that command string under that 
specific mode, distributed under handleNonGeneralCommand() method. If it still doesn’t parse successfully, 
it will be considered an invalid command and an error message will be printed out.

The classes Ui, ErrorMessage, HelpMessage and MainMenu help handle the printing of various user interfaces of the 
program. ErrorMessage, HelpMessage and MainMenu are subclasses of Ui to make use of the methods in Ui.

StudyIt class will also initialize various instances of classes such as TimeTableRun, FlashCardRun, 
ArrayList<BookmarkCategory>, ArrayList<Grade>, ArrayList<Person> and pass it to Command class to perform 
each mode’s functionality.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Bookmark Component

This bookmark section consists of how the bookmark feature is implemented. 
The bookmark feature is implemented similarly to the main architecture, however, 
in a smaller scale and a more bookmark-specific way. The figure below illustrates the general overview, 
the associations and the multiplicity of the bookmark classes.

![Bookmark Class Diagram](Images/BookmarkDG/BookmarkRun_Class.png)

**API:** <span style="color:blue">`BookmarkRun`.

The bookmark component consists of six major classes: `BookmarkRun`, `BookmarkStorage`, `BookmarkUi`, 
`BookmarkCategory`, `BookmarkList` and `BookmarkParser`. 
As shown in the figure above, `BookmarkRun` is 
* The main class to be called when the bookmark mode is accessed.
* The main class to access other bookmark classes.

The figure given below is the sequence diagram of how the classes interact with each 
other when bookmark mode is accessed from the main function.

![Bookmark Sequence Diagram](Images/BookmarkDG/Sequence_Diagram.png)

The bookmark component has two modes: the main bookmark mode and the category mode. 
As shown in the figure above, when `BookmarkRun` is called, 
`BookmarkParser` will be called and return a `BookmarkCommand`. 
Afterwards, `BookmarkRun` will then call `executeCommand` in `BookmarkCommand` which executes 
the intended actions. Then, it will call `getCategorymode` to get the current mode the user is in. 

**Bookmark Implementation**

A more detailed explanation of `BookmarkCommand`, `BookmarkCategory` and `BookmarkList` will be 
shown below. `BookmarkUi` and `BookmarkStorage` follow the same design implementations as the main 
architecture. The below figure shows the command classes available and they are called based on the 
`BookmarkParser` class as illustrated in the figure above. 

![BookmarkCommand ClassDiagram](Images/BookmarkDG/bookmarkCommand_Class.png)

The figure below shows a more detailed sequence diagram of how the `BookmarkCategory`, `BookmarkCommand` 
and `BookmarkList` interacts with each other for the scenario when the user input an `AddLinkCommand` 
in Bookmark mode.

![BookmarkCommand ClassDiagram](Images/BookmarkDG/AddCommand.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Timetable Component

This section will describe in detail how some features inside the timetable section have been 
implemented.

![Timetable Class Diagram](Images/TimeTable%20class%20diagram.png)

**API:** <span style="color:blue">`TimeTableRun`.

The timetable component consists of 7 major classes as shown. The above figure illustrates the
 association and the multiplicity of the classes. 
 
 1. As shown in the figure, `TimetableRun` is the main class to be accessed 
 when the timetable function is called. 
 1. It associates with the `TimeTableStorage` class which is used to save data into a text file 
 1. `DateList` class that contains a number of `EventList`. 
 1. `EventList` contains a number of `Event`. 
 1. `Event` class is the abstract parent class for `Lesson` and `Activity`. 
 1. `Event` class also contains a number of `Duration` and it has a dependency on the `EvenType` enum.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Timetable Implementation**

This section explains the details on how certain features are implemented in Timetable.

The figure below is the sequence diagram of the major interactions between classes when
the main function makes the run(command) API call and the command is "add class", 
"show schedule", "show link", or "delete class" .

![timetable_sequence diagram](Images/timetable_sequence%20diagram.png)

When command="add class" the `run(command)` method calls the `commandParse()` method from the `TimeTableParser` which the function
will call `addClass()` function from the `TimeTableCommand` Class. New `Lesson` Class will be initialised based on user input.
Following that a `addClassPeriod()` function will be called taking in the new lesson class initialised to add all the time slots
into lesson class. This class will then be returned to `TimetableParser` class where it will call the `addEvent()` method in DateList
to add the new `Lesson` Class into the arrayList within `DateList` Class. `WriteFile()` method in `Storage` will also be called to 
save the infomation of the new `Lesson` class to the data file.

Other possible commands that are not shown in the diagram will interact between classes in a similar way,
where command will be passed to the TimeTableParser Class where it interprets the command and calls the respective
function from the TimeTableCommand Class.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Academic Component

This section will describe in detail how some features inside the academic tracker section have been implemented.
The following diagram illustrates the general overview, the associations and the multiplicity of the academic classes.

![Academic_Class_Diagram](Images/Academic_Class_Diagram.png)

API: `java.academic`

The above diagram looks at the overall structure of how the academic tracker is being implemented. 
This component is split into 7 different classes, 
their associations and multiplicity as explained in the above diagram. 
The functions of the academic tracker will be called through the `AcademicRun` class 
when the program is in academic mode, which will subsequently call 
the functions in `PersonBook` or `GradeBook`. 


The academic component:
* initialises two arraylists, `ArrayList<Grade>` and `ArrayList<People>` 
to store the relevant `Grade` and `People` objects.
* uses `AcademicCommandParser` to parse the user command.
* identifies `AcademicCommandType` to decide 
which of the commands under `PersonBook` or `GradeBook` is to be executed.
* calls `AcademicStorage` to store the current set of data into the local storage file.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Academic Implementation**

This section explains the details on how certain features 
are implemented in the academic tracker.

**GradeBook Features**

The grade features are facilitated by `Gradebook`, which further make use of `Grade`. 
Each `Grade` will contain information such as the module's title, credits, grade, status of SU and status of star.
All grades are stored internally under `AcademicRun` as an array list `ArrayList<Grade>`.

It implements the following important operations:
* `addGrade(String[], ArrayList<Grade>)`:Adds a `Grade` to the `ArrayList<Grade>`. 
* `printCap(ArrayList<Grade>)`:Calculate the current CAP based on the `ArrayList<Grade>`. 
* `printListOfGrades(ArrayList<Grade>)`:Print out all the `Grade` that are currently stored inside `ArrayList<Grade>`.
* `deleteGrade(Integer, ArrayList<Grade>)`:Delete a `Grade` from a specified index inside `ArrayList<Grade>`.
* `suGradeInGradeBook(Integer, ArrayList<Grade>)`:Su a `Grade` from a specified index inside `ArrayList<Grade>`.
* `starGrade(Integer, ArrayList<Grade>)`:Star a `Grade` from a specified index inside `ArrayList<Grade>`.

The following diagram demonstrates an example of how the Su Grade function works:

<p align="center">
    <img width="70%" height="70%" src="Images/Academic_Sequence_Diagram.png">
</p>

With reference to above diagram, it can be observed that whenever a command modifies the array lists, 
`AcademicStorage` is called to update the local storage files.

**PersonBook Features**

The contact features are facilitated by `Personbook`, which further make use of `Person`. 
In terms of general structure, it is largely similar to that of `GradeBook`'s.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Flashcard Component

This section will describe in detail how the flashcard feature is implemented.


![Flashcard Component Class Diagram](Images/flashcard%20class%20diagram.png)

The above diagram looks at the overall structure of how the flashcard component is being implemented. 
This component is split into 4 different classes, their associations and multiplicity as explained in 
the above Figure. 
1. The main class `FlashcardRun` will be accessed when the flashcard mode is called in `StudyIt` Class. 
1. `FlashcardRun` class is associated with `FlashcardStorage` class that is used to store data in .txt file. 
1. `FlashcardDeck` class which contains any number of `Flashcards`.

**Flashcard Implementation**

This section explains the details on how certain features are implemented in flashcard.

When `FlashcardRun` is first initialised by `StudyIt`, it will construct 
the `FlashcardDeck` class.

![Sequence Diagram when user input “add card” command](Images/addCard_sequenceDiagram.png)

With reference to the figure above, as an "add card" command is given by the user, `FlashcardRun` will take in the 
command and call `addCard()` method in `FlashcardDeck` which constructs a new Flashcard object and stores 
it inside the `FlashcardDeck` object. The `addCard()` function will then show the user the question and 
answer of the flashcard that has been created.

Other possible commands that are not shown in the figure work in a similar way where command is parsed in `FlashcardRun` Class,
and calls the corresponding function within the `FlashcardDeck` Class. `WriteToFile` function is called at the end of the
process to update any changes to the deck to the data file.
