**Overview**

NotUS is a quick and simple, Command Line Interface (CLI) based, note-taking application for keyboard-inclined users. NotUS allows for users to categorize notes by tagging as well as pinning the more important notes. NotUS is also designed to assist in planning timetables to highlight possible clashes.

- In-charge of Events and Timetable of the code: Handles area of events, reminders and timetable scheduling and reviews changes done in this area.

**Summary of Contributions**

*Features implemented*

1. Set up and designed the architecture used for Event scheduling in the timetable.
    - Handled `Event`, `RecurringEvent`, `Timetable`, `Reminder` and other relevant `Command` subclasses for Event scheduling functionality.
    - Event functionality was designed with scalability in mind. Immutability was largely enforced to ensure consistency of Events even across re-occurrences. 
1. Implemented Single-Responsibility-Principle, Tell-Don't-Ask, and Liskov Substitution Principle in Designs.
    - Designed to reduce circular dependencies to reduce coupling.
1. Assisted in the development of two common `Parser` methods.
