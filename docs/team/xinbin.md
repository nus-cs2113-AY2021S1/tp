## Project: AniChan

**AniChan** is a desktop application created for anime translators to help efficiently manage their workload and time. It has a wide variety of tools that can help improve their workflow efficiency and translation accuracy. **AniChan** is built for fast typists, as such the user will interact with it through a CLI. It is written in Java with almost 14K LOC. 

### Summary of Contributions

*   **Application setup**: Loading of anime information from JSON data file
    *   What it does: Setting up the anime information from offline data sources, the data sources are stored as JSON files embed within our program. The file data requires a parser to properly extract anime information and convert it into an anime object, which will be used by many features to query anime information.   
    *   Justification: By extracting anime data, the program can easily use anime-related functions. As a translator, it is crucial to have anime information that is required by the translator.
    *   Highlights: The implementation was challenging as the JSON parser library I was familiar with was rejected, this means I have to use a new JSON library. JSON simple which was the library approved, could not read our entire JSON file and our data files have to be divided into smaller JSON files. In addition, the need to embed our data file into our release file took us a while to figure the mechanism out. 

*   **New Feature**: Added the ability to add, list, delete a bookmark. With extended features to view, edit the episode, add a note and remove a note for a bookmark entry.
    *   What it does: Allows the user to track the anime of their interest, with additional personalisation like specifying the current episode or adding notes to the bookmark entry.
    *   Justification: This bookmarking feature was designed to be a shortcut to the anime information they require, then extended features then allow the bookmark to keep additional information for particular anime that is useful to the translators.
    *   Highlights: The biggest challenge was the requirement for all bookmark features to share a single bookmark command, bookmark command has to accommodate seven bookmark actions without being too complicated to the users. This is done using multiple parameters and different combinations of variable signature types. Additionally, the bookmark parser and bookmark command logic are branched by the type of bookmark action to perform with various checks and validations.

*   **New Feature:** Added the ability to save and load bookmark data automatically.
    *   What it does: Helps the user to automatically save their bookmark data into the file `bookmark.txt`, and loads the data found in this file automatically when the application is launched.
    *   Justification: Being an application to help users keep track of their anime, the current episodes, and the anime notes, persistent storage would be essential to ensure users not would have to re-enter their bookmark information each time they use the application.
    *   Highlights: When loading bookmark data, each entry (each line) recorded in `bookmark.txt` would be split into parts that form a bookmark entry. If the object do not properly form each bookmark object they are deemed corrupted. If the bookmark is corrupted, then only that specific bookmark cannot be loaded, the rest of the bookmark(s) will still be loaded if they are valid.
