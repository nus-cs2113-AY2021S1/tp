## Project: PlaNUS

PlaNUS - PlaNUS is a desktop application for NUS students to manage their tasks and 
schedule, optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to display tasks by day, week and month. Under these modes,
user could use 'q', 'w' and 'e' to quit, view previous period and next period respectively. 

  * What it does: allows the user to view the tasks under different display modes and 
  adjust the viewing period without to enter a full command.
  
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as a user can focus on tasks over a specific period
   (day, week, month) and change the period conveniently.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo previous modification commands like add, edit, delete.

  * What it does: allows the user to undo modification commands one at a time until it reaches startup state. 
  
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as a user can easily revert a mistake without having
  the trouble to enter one or multiple full commands to rectify it.
