  [\#94](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/94),
  [\#100](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/100))
  * What it does: Add the ability to print the personal calendar for all calendar items of the user.  
                  User can decide to print the default calendar, weekly calendar, 
                  monthly calendar and personalised calendar.  
  * Justification: The feature enables the users to have an overview of all the calendar items in a timeline format.
  * Highlights: This feature is able to print all the calendar items in a timeline format, so that it presents 
  how many tasks the user has on each day. Timelines provide a simple visual overview of all the items the user
  has, and help the user with better time management.

#### Enhancement to existing features:
* Standardised the `getDescription()` function that returns the details of calendar items.
  ([\#72](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/72))
* Wrote Junit tests to increase coverage.
  ([\#180](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/180))
* Wrote the `inputDateProcessor` function that converts input time Strings into LocalDate.
