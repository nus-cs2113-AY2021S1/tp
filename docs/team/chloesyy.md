# Seah Yi Yi Chloe - Project Portfolio Page for Quotesify

## Overview
I am part of a team of 5 software engineering students, and we were tasked to design and implement a
Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application for our team project. The application that we developed
is called Quotesify. I was tasked with the Book Management System in Quotesify.

### About the Project
Quotesify is a free desktop application to help book readers improve their reading experience. With Quotesify,
users can add books and quotes they wished to remember into the application. Users can also categorize their books and
quotes, as well as rate their books. Quotesify is also built with a progress tracker to manage your reading activities.

## Summary of Contributions
This section shows a brief summary of my contributions to the team project, including coding, documentation
and other helpful contributions throughout the development of Quotesify.

### Code contributed

### Enhancements Implemented
I implemented the Book Management feature of Quotesify. 
 
**What it does:**
* The user may use the `add -b` command to add books, together with a specified author, to a booklist in Quotesify.
* The user may use the `edit -b` command to edit book titles of existing books in Quotesify.
* The user may use the `done -b` command to mark books that they've completed as done. 
* The user may use the `list -b` command to list existing books in the booklist. They have the option to:
    * List all existing books 
    * List books by a specified existing author
    * List books which they have completed or have yet to complete
* The user may use the `find -b` command to find books with titles or authors containing a particular keyword or phrase.

**Justification:**
The Book Management feature is a core feature of Quotesify which forms the backbone of Quotesify. 
This feature is useful for users to keep track of their books and their completion progress. 

**Highlights:**
The booklist is always sorted in alphabetical order for ease of access and reading when users list their books. 
Also, the find feature is case-insensitive. This is useful as users may not be able to remember the exact case in which 
they typed the book title or author. 

### Contributions to the UG:
* I contributed to the parts of the UG that describe and explain the Book Management System. 

### Contributions to the DG:
* I contributed to the parts of the DG that describe and explain the Book Management System, 
including the UML diagrams.

### Contributions to team-based tasks:
* I took notes for the team during team meetings to keep track of tasks to be done.
* I maintained the cohesiveness in language and formatting of the documentations.

### Contributions beyond the project team: 
I contributed in helping to identify bugs for other teams which can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-1/tp/issues)
 and gave feedback on documentations for other teams.
