## Project: NuSchedule:

NuSchedule is a desktop task management application used for keeping track of user's events. The user interacts with it 
using a Command Line Interface (CLI). It is written in Java and has around 5 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to this project:

* __New Feature:__ Added the ability to view all available commands
    * What it does: This function allows users to view the current version of this application by typing in `help`, and gives them a brief 
    description of all features. This function also provides users with a link to the detailed user guide.
    * Justification: This feature improves the user-friendliness of this application greatly as users may choose to 
    refer to help message whenever they feel lost or are unfamiliar yet with the usage of NuSchedule. Also, with further
    development of NuSchedule, there will be more and more features/commands available, this function will become more 
    and more useful for users to refer to.
    * Highlights: The code for this function needs to be updated everytime there is a new feature, or a new version release.
    
* __New Feature:__ Added the ability to clear events based on users' needs
    * What it does:  This function allows users to clear all events by typing in `clear`, or clear events that happened 
    before a certain date by typing in `clearBefore CLEAR_DATE`, or enable autoClear function of this application by
    typing in `autoClear`, which clears all events that happened one month ago automatically.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product efficiency and user-friendliness as it allows the space and memory
    for data storage to be reduced, hence the speed of running this application can be increased. This function also 
    allows users to view all their events more efficiently as those unwanted events are cleared, users will be able to
    have a more clean and straight-forward view of all ongoing events.
    * Highlights: This function allows 3 different commands, and the status of `autoClear` function can be kept after
    the application stops running.
