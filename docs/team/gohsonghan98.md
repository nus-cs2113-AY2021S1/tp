### Enhancements implemented

- Implemented View Command 
    - This class enables users to view profile information, help, food entries, exercise entries
     , and calorie summary. Different non-trivial methods are designed for non-similar view command types. 
    - A note-worthy design is with the view summary command. In this method, both exercise and food list have to be
     compared together,entry by entry, and sorted into a new combined ArrayList according to the dates of the entry
     . A separate date formatter is created to facilitate the sorting process. Upon successful sorting, the program
     finally outputs a list of caloric summary in ascending order of the date.  

- Implemented User Class: 
    - This class stores all the user profile information (i.e. name, age, gender, height, weight
    , fitness level) and includes get and set methods for such information. Methods used for caloric calculation
    are also implemented here.
    - Ensured that there is sufficient OOP here to support more diverse implementations and scalability of Fitr.
 
- Implemented StandardExerciseStorage class:
    - This class loads four different exercise lists from the resources folder into Fitr. The exercise lists is
    used by the `Recommender` class to recommend exercises.
     
- User Experience improvement:
    - For edit profile and view command: Added helpful tips and error messages to give users convenience and improve
     self-sufficiency of the Fitr program.

- JUnit tests:
    - Added some JUnit tests for product's quality assurance.
