# Puah Siew Wen - Project Portfolio Page for traKCAL

## Overview
* **traKCAL** is a desktop application for managing calorie intake, optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI) whilst retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). **traKCAL** can manage your activities faster than traditional GUI applications.

### Summary of Contributions
This section shows a brief overview of my contribution to traKCAL. It includes contributions like code writing, code documentation, UG/DG writing and other contributions for traKCAL.

#### Enhancements implemented

* I implemented the `add activity`, `edit activity`, `viewing help` and `chaining` enhancements. 

Here are some of their commands: 
>Words that look like THIS are parameters to be input by user
>Words that look like <this> are optional parameters

* `add f/ FOOD_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT <d/ DATE>` to add a new food activity.
* `add e/ EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT <d/ DATE>` to add a new exercise activity.
* `edit f/ FOOD_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT` to edit activity in list.
* `edit f/ EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT` to edit activity in list.
* `help` to display the help list.

For chaining, examples of the usages are:
* `add e/ EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT <d/ DATE> && list && graph`
* `list && edit f/ FOOD_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT && graph`
