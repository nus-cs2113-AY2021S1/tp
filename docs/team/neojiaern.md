## Project: KAJI

### Overview 

KAJI is a desktop command line interface application catered for university students to schedule their revision, as well as allow them to revise content in the form of flashcards. It is written in java.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project:

* New Feature: Added the ability to remove modules/chapters/flashcards.
  * What it does: Allows the user to remove modules/chapter/flashcards that are no longer needed.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows user to completely remove data of a module/chapter/flashcard if he does not want to keep it anymore. In addition, removing content decreases the amount of storage space needed.
<br>
* New Feature: Added the ability for the user to do a revision.
  * What it does: Allows the user to revise on chapters he wants in the form of flashcards.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to do their revision in the form of flashcards and even takes in input on user's rating of each flashcard in order for the scheduler to schedule the next time the chapter should be revised.
