## Overview

Our team has developed a command line interface application called Zoomaster which helps NUS students to store 
information of their lesson timetable and website links. Zoomaster can launch the stored websites such as zoom links 
in a quick and convenient way, and has a feature to help students plan for group meetings by collating their timetable.

#### Enhancements implemented:  
* The ability for the user to enter multiple commands in one shot when adding a module to the timetable. 
The user can add lesson slots, and bookmarks to the module as well as the lesson slots in one command, instead of 
entering the details one line at a time, allowing fast typists to set up their timetable faster.
* Support for launching URLs on the different operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux and Unix.

#### Contributions to the UG:  
* Instructions for commands  
    * launch now (Global Commands)
    * Show module and slot details (timetable mode)
    * Delete module, slot and bookmarks (timetable mode)
    * Launch bookmarks from modules and slots (timetable mode)

#### Contributions to the DG:  
* The descriptions of the implementation of addSlotCommand and deleteSlotCommand. 
* Added class and sequence diagrams to explain the implementation of both commands.
