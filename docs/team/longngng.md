## Overview

Zer0Note is a note taking and organisation application meant for students(especially those who can type fast). It combines the features of note-taking apps (like OneNote) with the interaction speed of command-line based tools like vim and emacs. It helps students (like yourself!) to keep track of deadlines and take notes quickly.
