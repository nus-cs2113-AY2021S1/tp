## Project: PlaNUS

PlaNUS is a desktop application for NUS students to manage their tasks and schedule,
optimized for Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature:** Added the ability to edit existing tasks.
    - What it does: Allows the user to edit every component of each task that were already
    in the list.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product as the user may want to edit specific
    components of the task after already having added them to the list.
- **New Feature:** Added the ability to redo/restore previous commands.
    - What it does: Allows the user to reverse executed undo commands and
    restore previous changes.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product as the user may want to
    restore commands that they have undone, thus greatly enhancing the user experience
    of the application.
