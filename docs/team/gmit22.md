# Gunit Mittal - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
My team and I created a command line interface for project managers to organize and manage work.
Our CS2113T product, SCRUMptious makes collaboration for users much easier than before, and digitalizes the entire
 process for product managers.
* Documentation 
* Worked with `model` and `logic` component of the application
* `Project` and `Member` related classes, and all commands relevant to these.

 [#131](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/131)
 
 Created Architecture diagram for the Developer guide, added sequence diagrams and class diagrams to improve
 understanding of the project. Create sequence diagram for `CreateProjectCommand` to better understand the workflow
  and user interaction when the application is run, and project is created. Added [user stories, value proposition and 
  target user profile with implementaion and usage scenario for 
  commands.](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/140).
