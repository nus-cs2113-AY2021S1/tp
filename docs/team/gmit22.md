# Gunit Mittal - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview

My team and I created a command line interface for project managers to organize and manage work.
Our CS2113T product, SCRUMptious makes collaboration for users much easier than before, and digitalizes the entire
 process for product managers.
* Documentation 
* Worked with `model` and `logic` component of the application
* `Project` and `Member` related classes, and all commands relevant to these.

#### Assertions, Logging and Unit testing
* **PR** [#82](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/82),
[#86](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/86),

[#210](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/210).

* Added logging to allow the team to view records of certain information
 during a program execution for future reference.
* Used assertions to double check and making sure that the program state does not violate the assumptions regarding
  behaviour. Helped in finding bugs in code.

Solved bugs addressed in PED Dry Run by other students. There were some bugs which needed to be 
solved, but most feedback was on user guide section. Some high severity bugs solved by [#158](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/issues/158)
and [#164](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/issues/164).

Set up the draft of User Guide for initializing the application in `Project`, `Member`
command. Updated the expected output of commands for V2.0 in 
[#119](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/119). 
Many PED Bugs were also solved in [#178](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/178), with many of them
being high severity, and affecting the entire functionality of the program. 
 
 #### Developer Guide

 [#131](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/131)

Created Architecture diagram for the Developer guide, added sequence diagrams and class diagrams to improve
understanding of the project. Create sequence diagram for `CreateProjectCommand` to better understand the workflow
and user interaction when the application is run, and project is created. Added [user stories, value proposition and 
target user profile with implementaion and usage scenario for 
commands.](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/140)
