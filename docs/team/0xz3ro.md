## 1. Overview
After 7 weeks of coding and revisions, a group of 5 enthusiastic NUS Computing students, proudly present to you our newest product, in the scope of CS2113T-Software Engineering and Object Oriented Programming module, **FLUFFLE**!
<br>
**FLUFFLE** is a writer's swiss army knife of writing tools, idea generation and organisation. While most writing applications provide the user with a GUI, Fluffle provides a CLI interface that is both lightweight and portable. Users can focus on their writing without distractions and can really help advance their writing.
<br>
The latest release of Fluffle can be accessed from **[here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W11-4/tp/releases/tag/v2.1)**.
