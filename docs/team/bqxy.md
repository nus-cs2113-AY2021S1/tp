## Project: FinanceIt
FinanceIt is an all-in-one desktop application that handles the finance tracking needs of university students who are 
comfortable with a CLI interface. It includes 5 different finance tools, all of which take in typed commands from the 
users to execute their respective functions. <br/>
<br/>
Given below are my contributions to the project. <br/>
* **New Feature**
  * Added the ability to calculate interest earned over a period. 
    ([\#29](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/pull/29),
     [\#80](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/pull/80),
     [\#81](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/pull/81))
    * What it does: allows the user to calculate either simple interest or compound interest.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as interest computation and knowledge is an 
                     integral component of any finance-related product.
    * Highlights: The optional yearly or monthly deposits helps enhance the capability of this feature and more 
                  accurately reflects real-world situations.
    
  * Added the ability to calculate cashback and miles credit earned. 
    ([\#40](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/pull/40))
    * What it does: allows the user to calculate either cashback or miles credit earned.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as cashback and miles credit calculations are 
                     relevant to the project's target users who own a credit card.
    * Highlights: The cashback calculator also includes an option to include the monthly cap so that the calculation
                  is made easier for user.

  * Documentation Management 
    ([\#219](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/issues/219), 
     [\#218](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/issues/218)
     [\#166](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/issues/166))
                              
* **Enhancements to existing features**
  * Added ability to store account information. 
    ([\#93](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/pull/93),
     [\#109](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/pull/109))
    * What it does: allows user to store account-related information such as interest rate and cashback rate.
    * Justification: This feature caters to user who have multiple accounts with different interest rate, etc. It allows
                     them to refer their accounts easily.
    * Highlights: It also includes a feature to list account(s) information in the program, clear all information and
                 delete account stored in the program.
  
  * Added ability to store commands inputted by user and results of calculations. 
    ([\#108](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/pull/108),
     [\#253](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/pull/253))
    * What it does: allows the user to store the commands inputted and results from calculations
    * Justification: This feature allows user to compare interest computations from different input values so that
                     they can decide which inputs has the best interest they can potentially accrue.
    * Highlights: It also shows the past commands inputted by the user for reference.
    
  * Wrote additional test for existing feature to increase coverage. 
    ([\#114](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T16-1/tp/pull/114))
