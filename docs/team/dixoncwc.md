## Project: FinanceIt
FinanceIt is an all-in-one desktop application that handles the finance tracking needs of university students who are 
comfortable with a CLI interface. In the application, it consists of 5 sub-application that helps student to manage
their finance. <br/>
<br/>
Given below are my contributions to the project. <br/>

* **Code contributed:** [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=dixoncwc&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-09-27&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **New Features** 
  * Implemented Setting of Goals feature
    * What it does: It allows user to set expense/income goals.
    * Justification: This features improve the application significantly as user can now set a target that they want
                     inside the application without having to remember it by themselves. 
    * Highlights: In budget managing, setting target goals is essential as it helps user to micro manage 
                  their finance.
                
  * Implemented Editing of Goals feature
    * What it does: It allows user to edit their expense/income goals for a specific month.
    * Justification: This features improves the application significantly as user can make mistakes in typing their 
                     goal in the console and this feature will allow user to edit it without having to delete it. 
    * Highlights: This features requires changes to existing command as we have to extract the data from the arraylist
                  and overwrite it.
                  
  * Implemented Display of Goals feature
    * What it does: It allows user to display their expense/income goals for a specific month.
    * Justification: This features improves the application significantly as user might forget their goal or lost track
                     of their saving/expenditure so this allows the user to refer and keep track of the progress.
    * Highlights: It also tells the user if they have reached their desired goals, if not they will calculate the 
                  difference and prompt the user whether how much is left to spend/ how much more he/she need to save
                  before reaching his/her income goals.
