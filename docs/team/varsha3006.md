# Varsha - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
I am part of a team of 4 software engineering students and we were tasked to design and implement a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application for our team project. 
Our application is called **CCA Manager**. 

### About the project
CCA Manager is a revolutionary all-in-one management tool that changes the way 
you can manage interest groups with unrivaled efficiency and simplicity. It has 3 features 
in total, HR, Finance and Events. I was tasked with the Event Feature for our program.

This section shows a brief summary of my contributions to the team project, including coding, documenting and other helpful contributions throughout the development of CCA Manager.

#### Features Added
 **New features:** \
I added to the event feature in this project. Specifically  `CommandEventAdd`, `CommandEventDel`, `CommandEventList`  ,`CommandEventStatus`, `CommandSearchEvent` and `CommandEventCountdown`

* The user will be able to use `event addEvent` to add a new event to the list.   <br/>
* The user may also use `event delEvent <index>` or `event delEvent all` command to delete an existing event or all events in the list. <br/>
* To mark an event as completed, user can use `event done <index>` <br/>
* The user can use `event listEvent` to list all the events in the list. <br/>
* The user can use `event search` to find events. They have the option to:
  * Search by Event date <br/>
  * Search by Event name <br/>
 * The user can use   `event countdown` to see number of days left to the upcoming event. <br/>

**Enhancements Added:**
* User will not be able add an event that matches in name and date with an existing event.
* User can delete all events in the list with a confirmation message so that user doesn't accidentally delete all events data.
* User will be able to search by both date and name
* User will be able to see a countdown to upcoming events sorted by the earliest deadline first.
