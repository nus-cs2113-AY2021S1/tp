## Overview

Study It is an interactive desktop app that helps students manage their study related matters, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). 
Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features added: 

* Designed the structure of the academic mode.
  * What it does: allows the user to access all the different features in academic mode.
  * Justification: it is the main framework for the entire academic mode, and facilitates all the various functions.
  * Highlights: it is a very flexible framework that allows for new features to be added easily.
  * Credits: the program was coded from scratch.
    
* Added the function to manage contacts
  * What it does: allows user to add, delete, check and mark out contacts.
  * Justification: as an all-in-one academic helper, the ability to keep track of important contacts of professors
  and TAs is very helpful to students using this app.
  * Highlights: there is a clear structure in the different segments of the codes(i.e. PersonBook & Person),
  thus modifications and additions can be made easily without affecting how other functions work.
  * Credits: the program was coded from scratch, but the star contact segment was added by Yuan Bing.
    
* Added the function to manage grades
  * What it does: allows user to add, delete, check and mark out grades, as well as su a grade and check his/her CAP.
  * Justification: it is important for students to keep track of their grades throughout their course in university,
  and study it lets the student do that with ease.
  * Highlights: the app can calculate CAP accurately, taking into consideration factors like module credits, grades,
  and SUs.
