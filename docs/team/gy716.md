* **Enhancement implemented**:
  * Link to the NUSMods API, which allows the user to check the detailed information of an added module. There are many difficulties in packing json file fetched from API into the jar file. 
  * Allow the user to add the different timeslots freely rather than subject to the limitations of the timeslots provided by NUSMods.
  * Add a feature to have an overview of all the information of all the modules added.
* **Contributions to documentations**:
  * User Guide: Write the features of adding modules and checking modules in the sections of features and command summary.
  * Developer Guide: Write the design section of the developer guide and add architecture diagrams and class diagrams.
* **Contributions beyond the project team**
  * Response to the other's questions in the forum.[Link](https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/forum/issues/83)
  * Bugs reported to other teams' products.[Link](https://github.com/gy716/ped/issues)
