It is optimised for use via the Command Line Interface (CLI) and it serves as an efficient one stop application for our users to manage their time. 

### Summary of Contributions
#### Code contributed:
[RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=imhm)

#### New Features implemented:

##### Establishing the overall structure of the code
Created the `CalendarList`, `CalendarItem`, `SchoolEvent`, `Exam`, `Lab`, `Tutorial`, `Lecture` classes, separating
 the `Event` class and the `Task` class. [#27](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/27)
* Highlights: It requires heavy change to the existing features to fit the new design. (Changing from the task list
 in Duke to a new Calendar list. Changing existing features to fit a specific class ie. mark as done only works for
  tasks.[#47](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/47))
* Credits: The team came up with the class diagram for the CalendarList together. The overall design of the code is reused from my iP's code.

##### Additional information for event class 
* What it does: Users are able to add/view/delete a list of information pertaining to the event
* Justification: This feature is unique and useful as it serves as a one stop application to
 store all data in your calendar.

#### Enhancements to existing features implemented:

* Find Feature [#74](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/74)
    * What it does: Users can use a keyword to search for an item from their list of tasks, or their list of events or the
 entire calendar list.
    * Justification: Users can narrow their search based on the item.

* Delete Feature [#47](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/47)
    * What it does: Users can delete an event or a task.
    * Justification: As the users can view their events list and task lists, they can remove unwanted tasks or events
 based on the indexing of the task/event in the task/event list.

* Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage. [#81](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/81)
