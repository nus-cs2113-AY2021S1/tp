[RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=zhangyilin0203)
### Enhancements implemented:
* Added ability to save and load data to local file.
 ([\#17](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/17),
  [\#31](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/31),
  [\#58](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/58),
  [\#90](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/90))
  * What it does: Add the ability to store the changed data to a local file
                   and load the data to the application when the application opens.
  * Justification: The feature improve the application significantly as it can let users store the data they have 
                   already written to the program, which increase the efficiency of the application.
  * Highlights: This feature is able to store the changed data locally even if user accidentally close the application.
                Also, if the user wants to switch to another device, he or she can copy and paste the content to that device,
                so that the other device could store exactly the same information.

* Added ability to print the countdown for exams and deadlines.
  ([\#77](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/77),
   [\#168](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/168))
   * What it does: Add the ability to print the countdown for deadline tasks and exam events.
                   User can decide to print only the countdown for only the deadline task or exam events or both.
   * Justification: This feature allows user to view how much time is left for their deadline and exams so that they can
                    better prepare for them.
   * Highlights: This feature is able to print countdown in the ascending order, so that the most urgent task 
                 or event is at the top. If the deadline or exam date is within a day, countdown command will print out
                 messages like *'its time to speed up'* or *'try your best'* to encourage the user.

* Added more JavaDoc comments for some public methods.
  ([\#73](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/73))
