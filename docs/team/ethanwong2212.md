## Overview
#### Project: Nav@NUS
Nav@NUS is an application which helps users navigate themselves around NUS through the NUS shuttle services. The application runs on the Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### New Feature: Show buses available at bus stop
 * What it does: Allows users to find the buses available at a specific bus stop.
 * Justification: This is an important feature as it allows users easy access to the buses available at the stop in the event they are planning to change buses.
 
#### New Feature: Execution of favourite command
 * What it does: Allows user to execute commands directly from their list of favourite commands.
 * Justification: This is an important feature as the command to execute a favourite command directly from the list can be significantly shorter. This helps users obtain required information quicker and reduces the posibility of spelling errors when typing long conventional commands.
