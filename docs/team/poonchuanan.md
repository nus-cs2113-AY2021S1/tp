# Poon Chuan An - Project Portfolio Page for traKCAL

## Overview
**traKCAL** is a desktop application for managing calorie intake, optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI) whilst retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). **traKCAL** can manage your activities faster than traditional GUI applications.

#### Enhancements implemented

* I implemented the `find` functions. Besides the basic features of the find function, I implemented more advanced search functions as well for more complex search requirements.
* I also helped out with the `storage` and a one part of `logging` enhancements. 

Here are some of the commands: 
>Words that look like THIS are parameters to be input by user

* `find d/ KEYWORD` to find all entries with description containing the KEYWORD.
* `find c/ KEYWORD` to find all entries with calories matching the KEYWORD.
* `find a/ KEYWORD1 / KEYWORD2 / KEYWORD3..` to find entries with all matching KEYWORDs.
* `find e/ KEYWORD1 / KEYWORD2 / KEYWORD3..` to find entries with at least one matching KEYWORDs.

#### Contributions to documentation
