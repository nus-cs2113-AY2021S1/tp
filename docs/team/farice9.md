## Project: Study it

Study It is an interactive all-in-one study companion to help you organize your study matters!

It is packed with 4 major features: bookmark, timetable, academic and flashcard to help store and arrange your
study matters in a thoughtful manner so that you can focus on Studying It!

The following are my contributions to the project!

### Features added: 

* **Designed the main architecture of the program and maintain it**
    * What it does: Provides proper partitioning and command parsing as well as program flow to ensure every team member's
    code can be fit into our program. I have also helped integrated each member's mode into the program.
    * Justification: For a program with 4 major features, I needed to design the architecture such that user can switch
    between the modes seamlessly and use the functionalities provided in each mode without clashing with the rest.
    * Highlights: With the main architecture, the infrastructure within each mode will not interfere with one another, 
    and the design is flexible enough to implement new features for future expansions.
    * Credits: The architectural code was coded from scratch.
    
* **Implemented general functions for the program**
    * Functions: `help`, `location`, `cd`, `exit`
    * What it does: These functions can be used anywhere throughout the program to help user navigate our app containing
    multiple modes. `help` instructs the user what commands are available in each mode. `location` informs the user
    their current mode. `cd` is used to switch between modes. `exit` is used to either exit the program or their current mode
    * Justification: We needed general functions to help user navigate our expansive app that has 4 major modes.
    * Highlights: `help` will print out help messages specific to the mode the user is currently at. `cd` can be used
    anywhere in the app and is modified to take in index number (for quicker navigation) or mode name (for meaningful interaction).
    * Credits: The general functions are implemented during the design of the system architecture.

* **Streamlined the user interface of the program**
    * What it does: Decided how the general user interface of the program should look like and helped streamlined it across
    multiple modes. 
    * Justification: A clean user interface will improve the user's experience while using our application.
    * Highlights: Provided some thoughtful functionality when designing user interface, such as printing the current time
    at the menu.
    * Credits: Mode specific interfaces were coded by each respective teammates and streamlined by me.
    
* **Added `highlight` function as one of the general functions**
    * What it does: It prints out the starred items from bookmark mode and academic mode
    * Justification: Allows user to quickly access the important informations he/she deemed important
    * Highlights: It can be called from anywhere in the app, allowing quicker access
    * Credits: Si Hui implemented the `star` function in bookmark mode but I implemented it within the academic mode which was
    designed by Ziyi. I made use of these 2 functionalities to run the `highlight` function.
