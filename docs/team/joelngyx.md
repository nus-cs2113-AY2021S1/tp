## Overview:

E-Duke-8 (pronounced "Educate") helps CS2113/T students learn and understand software engineering and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through a gamified platform and enhances their learning experience. 


## Summary of Contributions:

- **New Feature:** Topic and TopicList components. 
  - What it does: The TopicList component stores Topic objects, each of which stores the description, note list and question list of the topic.
  - Justification: Necessary for the compartmentalization of data

- **New Feature:** Implemented the NoteCommand component
  - What it does: This command is a type Command object. Entering an input containing the following formats: `note add`, 
  `note delete`, `note list` will throw this command and process the instruction provided.
  - Justification: Necessary to add/delete/list notes.
  - Highlight: This feature required the use of logic, as well as interactions with various classes such as `TopicList`, 
  `Ui`, `NoteList` and `Note`. Methods were added to the `Ui` class to allow for a more user-friendly way of providing 
  inputs when it comes to creating/deleting/listing out `Note` objects in the specified `NoteList` object.

- **New Feature:** Implemented the Note and NoteList components.
  - What it does: The NoteList components store Note objects, and contains methods that can modify the NoteList object.
  - Justification: Necessary to process and carry out the NoteCommand.

- **Enhancements to existing features:**
  - Removed redundant code in the DisplayableList interface which allowed for the better implementation of features.
  Made necessary additions and amendments to various classes and JUnits tests. [#122](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-3/tp/pull/122)
  - Made necessary additions and amendments to the UserStorage class to accommodate improvements made to the `Note` and `NoteList` classes.
