## Overview
Scheduler--; is a desktop app for managing deadlines from different sources. The user will use a Command Line Interface to control it. It is specially designed for Computing students who are comfortable in using CLI and have Git project deadlines as well as consolidated Zoom session links due which will suit home based learning in this COVID period.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Summary of Contributions

- **New Feature:** Added the ability to set/update deadline for personal events
    * What it does: Allows the user to set or change the deadline for personal events.
