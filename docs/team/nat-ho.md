# Ho Chong Han Nathaniel - Project Portfolio Page for Quotesify

## Overview
I am part of a team of 5 software engineering students and we were tasked to design and implement a
Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application for our team project. The application that we developed
is called Quotesify. I was tasked with the Quote Management and Quote Reflection feature in Quotesify.

Quotesify is an application to help book readers improve their reading experience. With Quotesify,
users can add books and quotes they wished to remember into the application. Users can also categorize their books and
quotes, as well as rate their books. Quotesify is also built with a progress tracker to manage your reading activities.

## Summary of Contributions
This section shows a brief summary of my contributions to the team project, including coding, documentation
and other helpful contributions throughout the development of Quotesify.

### Code contributed:

### Enhancements implemented:
1. Quote Management feature in Quotesify.

    **What it does:**
    * The user may use the `add -q` command to add quotes in Quotesify.
    * The user may use the `edit -q` or `delete -q` command to edit or delete an existing quote in Quotesify.
    * The user may use the `list -q` command to list all existing quotes, list quotes from a specified author,  list quotes from a specified reference or both.
    * The user may also use the `find -q` command to find quotes that contains the specified keyword.

    **Justification:**
    The Quote Management system is designed to help users log important and meaningful quotes from books and information 
    found on the web, as they are usually read and forgotten after a short period. This feature creates a personal repository 
    of those quotes, enabling users to revisit and find them effectively.
    
    **Highlights:**
    To enable a wider range of use cases, Quotesify accepts multiple formats for quotes. Author and reference are optional 
    flags that can be added to provide more information which will enable users to find and list quotes more efficiently. 
    Users will also be reminded of saved quotes, resurfacing and reminding them so that they can better remember them in the long run.
    
2. Quote Reflection feature in Quotesify.
    
    **What it does:**
    * The user may use the `add -qr` command to add a reflection to an existing quote in Quotesify.
    * The user may use the `edit -qr` or `delete -qr` command to edit or delete an existing reflection for a specified quote.
    * The user may use the `list -qr` command to list the reflection of a specified quote.
    
    **Justification:**
    According to "The forgetting curve", memory for any information decays over time if we do not actively engage with it.
    By making it more interactive and allowing users to actively engage with the content through their own reflection
    and summary, users are far more likely to internalize the content and remember it in the long run. 

### Contributions to documentation:
* I have contributed to all parts relating to Quote Management and Quote Reflection in the UG.
* Additionally, I also contributed to the FAQ section of the UG.

### Contributions to the DG:
* I have contributed to all parts relating to Quote Management and reflection in the DG, including all UML diagrams.
* I also contributed to other sections including Product Scope and User Stories.

### Contributions to team-based tasks:
* General formatting of UG and DG.
