## Overview
_ModTracker_ is a desktop app for NUS students to track the time spent 
as well as tasks to do for each of their modules.
It helps students to prioritise their work and 
balance their time spent amongst their modules. 
This app uses a Command Line Interface (CLI).

#### Enhancements Implemented
The main features that I worked on for this project are add time, minus time and edit time functions. 
These functions help modify the actual time spent on each module in the user specified week.

As for the feature enhancements, here are the enhancements made to the three aforementioned functions:

* Round off to 1 decimal place feature. This enhancement rounds off the user input to 1 decimal place to ensure
consistency with the data we are capturing and showing to our user.
* Summary feature. This enhancement allows user to view a summary of their time spent in their specified week 
after using the function.

#### Contributions to User Guide
I contributed to the program features by adding the details of the 
_addtime_, _minustime_ and _edittime_ features (Section 2.4, 2.10, 2.11) in the user guide.

#### Contributions to the Developer Guide
I contributed to the _documentation_ (Section 5) part of the developer guide. I 
added the implementations of the _addtime_ (Section 4.3), _minustime_ (Section 4.4) and _edittime_ (Section 4.5)
features. 
I also added two sequence diagrams under these implementations. 

#### Contributions to Team-based Tasks
I tested our team's app to find bugs and helped managed errors in codes when our functions conflict with each
other's. I also set up logging file for the team.
Additionally, also edited the demo video for our team.
On top of that, also helped to find documentation issues and rectify them when needed.

#### Contributions Beyond the Project Team
I provided feedback to the other teams' code and their documentations. I also tested other teams' apps in which I 
reported bugs found to them and also provided suggestions.
