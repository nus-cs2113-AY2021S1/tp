### Enhancements implemented

- Implemented Goal feature
    - This feature allows users to keep motivated to complete their goals
    - Implemented smart goals to link the user's calories with their goals, where Fitr will update the status of their goal with the user's calorie consumed and calories burnt data (from the goal's created date)
    - Allow user to mark goals as complete, including overriding the smart goals function to ensure the user has control over the progress of the goals
    - Allow user to manipulate goals data (including editing, deleting, clearing goal list) 
    - Ordered goals based on date created and status of goals when viewed so that the user is more encouraged to complete an uncompleted/old goal
    
- Implemented UI class
    - This class prints all the messages the user sees, including colour coded words (e.g. red for errors, blue for additional feature tips etc.) and reads user inputs
    - Consolidated the formats of all commands so that the user can know what commands and formats are available through the help command
    - Added a format error method to print customised format errors for the various commands 
    
- Added JUnit tests
    - Added some JUnit tests to the goal components
