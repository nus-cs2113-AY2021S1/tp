## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Project Overview 
DOMNUS - is a desktop application that helps in module and task tracking. It was developed under the module CS2113 Software Engineering & Object Oriented Programming. Within the schedule of approximately 7 weeks, my team of 5 Computer Engineering students successfully created DOMNUS to help students to stay organize with respective to the modules they take in NUS. 

## 2. Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project. 

### 2.1 Enhancements Implemented: 

* New Feature: Reminder
	* What it does:
Allows the user to set reminder for tasks that are due within 3 days
	* Justification:
This feature allow users to know what tasks are going to be due by having a message every 5 minutes
	* Highlights:
This feature can be further integrated to remind top 10 tasks in the future
	* Credits (optional):
@johanesrafael for improving the code quality

* New Feature: Postpone

	* Justification:
This feature allows users to 
	* Highlights:

	* Credits (optional):
@johanesrafael for improving the code quality 
<br>

* New Feature: Snooze
	* What it does:
Allows the user to delay the "pop up" message by "snoozing" it
	* Justification:
Reminder "pop up" message can be a little annoying if it comes up every 5 minutes, hence this feature gives user an option to delay the "pop up" message
	* Highlights:
Snooze feature can be improved by adding more fields to cater for more options
	* Credits (optional):
@johanesrafael for improving the code quality
<br>

* New Feature: Focus
	* What it does:
Allows the user to change context to "todo", "event", "deadline", "task", "mod", "selected" or "taken"
	* Justification:
Instead of viewing a whole list of combined tasks, changing context to specific task such as "todo" only lists on "todo" stuff and makes viewing of tasks neater
	* Highlights:
This feature can be enhanced to change the context to multiple context such as "todo" and "event" in the future
	* Credits (optional): 
@tomlbz for fixing the bugs and code quality
