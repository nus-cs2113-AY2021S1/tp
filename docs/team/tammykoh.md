## Overview
WhereGotTime is an application for students to add, edit and check their timetable schedules.
It is also able to compare timetable with their peers to find a common timeslot 
so that they can schedule a study time together.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## Summary of Contributions

* **New Feature:**  Added the ability to list the user's timetable
    * What it does: allows the user to view their entire timetable, or their timetable on a particular day 
    * Justification: this feature allows users to view their timetable, so they know what they have on in that day or for that week

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to find classes
    * What it does: allows the user to search for their classes based on keywords
    * Justification: this feature improves the product as users do not have to look through the timetable for their class but can use this product to help them quickly search for it

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to delete a class
    * What it does: allows the user to delete a particular class in the day
    * Justification: this feature improves the product as users may accidentally input a class incorrectly, so they have a means to remove that class

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to clear classes
    * What it does: allows the user to clear all the classes in a day or clear the entire timetable
    * Justification: this feature improves the product as users may have to make significant changes to the timetable such as moving into a new semester where all the classes will be different
