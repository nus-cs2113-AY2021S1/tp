## Overview
_ModTracker_ is a desktop app for NUS students to track the time spent 
as well as tasks to do for each of their modules.
It helps students to prioritise their work and 
balance their time spent amongst their modules. 
This app uses a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Enhancements Implemented
The main features that I worked on for this project are the viewing functions.
They allow users to view their input data presented nicely in a table format.
These data consists of week number, module code, actual time spent and expected workload.
(Pull request [#8](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-4/tp/pull/8))

As for the feature enhancements, I made the analyse feature. It provides a breakdown of actual 
time spent in the week and a visual comparison between actual and expected workload. Analysis of
the amount of time spent by the user, and some relevant advice is also shown.

### Contributions to User Guide
I contributed to the program features by adding the details of the 
_list_ and _analyse_ features (Section 2.5, 2.6) in the user guide.

### Contributions to the Developer Guide
I contributed to the _use cases and Appendix_ (Section 6.3 and 7) part of the developer guide. I 
added the implementations of the _view modules_ (Section 4.6) and _Breakdown and analysis_ (Section 4.7) features. 
I also added two sequence diagrams under these implementations. 
(Pull request [#77](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-4/tp/pull/77),
[#83](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-4/tp/pull/83),
[#136](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-4/tp/pull/136))

### Contributions to Team-based Tasks
I set up the project repository and reviewed my teammates' codes. Moreover, 
I also conducted intensive testing on our app before the trial TP to find out as many 
hidden bugs as possible. I also helped to fix issues in my team's code and documentation.

### Contributions Beyond the Project Team
