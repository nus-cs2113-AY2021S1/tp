## Project: CEGMods

### Overview
CEGMods is a desktop application to manage NUS CEG's courses via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you are an NUS CEG 
looking for an app to manage your course and project schedule, CEGMods can help you get all your tasks down in an 
organised manner.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

### Summary of Contributions
* **New Feature**: Added colors to help and welcome messages
    *What it does: Makes the application more vibrant and easier for the user to see what is required for them to input.
    *Justification: As we have many features with a lengthy instruction page, it is important to make sure that the user is able to see and understand the instructions in the help page. Therefore, I have added this feature.
