### Enhancements implemented
- Allow the user to clear the individual list, or clear all the lists at the same time
    - This feature allows users to quickly empty the lists, if they want to start with a fresh list.
    - This feature is especially useful for users who may be trying the application for the first time, and may add random data to test the application. If they wish to use the application proper, they can immediately clear the lists, without having to delete the entries individually.
- Allow the user to edit a previous exercise or food entry in the lists
    - This feature allows users to correct mistakes that they make in a previous entry.
    - This was initially hard to implement as the `edit` command was also used to edit the user's profile. Hence, I created the `EditCommandParser` to handle the arguments in the `edit` command first. Once the arguments are parsed, it is then passed into a `EditEntryCommand` class and the corresponding entry is edited.
    - The command to edit a specific entry is also designed as a one-shot command, so users who can type fast in a command-line application can quickly edit an entry.
- Added a `ResourceManager` class to handle loading of resources in the JAR file
    - As Fitr requires some resources to be packaged together with the JAR file, such as the tips and exercise lists, the usual way of reading files using `File` and `Scanner` cannot be used.
    - Instead, `InputStream` and `InputStreamReader` is used to read the resources packaged in the JAR file.
- Added some JUnit tests
