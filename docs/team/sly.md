# Sun Ling Yue - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
I have worked on a project in year 2020. This project was about creating a command line program to manage
your finances. We were a team of five NUS students. Each of us has chosen a unique feature to work on. For my
part, I have created a save and load manager that maintain copies of past saves to be loaded at will.

#### Enhancement implemented

##### Version one
- Implemented saving and loading of tracker classes upon entry and exit from the program.
- Main function implementation as well as main menu implementation.
##### Version two
- Implemented save manager that allows adding, loading and deleting of multiple saves.
- Made sure saving is done the moment a change is made instead of only during program exit.
- Partially worked on saving of log files onto a text file.
- Created a Junit test case to test load and save feature by comparing contents of loaded save and new save.

#### Contribution to documentation
My contribution for User Guide is on a section called save Manager. It details how to use the save manager with given examples.

#### Contribution to developer's guide
My contribution of developer's guide is on a section called Storage utiliy as well as Save Manager manual testing and some user stories related to saving and
loading. Under the Save Manager section I also have created a class diagram and sequence diagram. Under Storage component I have also created an architecture
diagram and it's explaination.
