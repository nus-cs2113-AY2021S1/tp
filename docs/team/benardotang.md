# Benardo Tang - Project Portfolio Page for WatchNext

## Overview

## About the project
**WatchNext** is a show tracker designed for users who watch their favourite shows on multiple free streaming platforms and other open source streaming websites.
**WatchNext** records your progress for the different shows you are currently watching, and even for upcoming shows that you plan to watch.
<br>It additionally serves as a tracker to limit your weekly watch time to help you better manage your time.

## Summary of contributions
Given below are my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* **Feature**: Added the ability to track daily watch time through the `updatetimelimit` and `watch` command.
    * What it does: Allows the user to set a daily time limit to watch shows and maximise productivity. The time limit decreases when the user inputs the `watch` command and alerts the user when he/she has exceeded or reached the daily limit.
    * Justification:  This feature improves the product significantly as the user has an additional benefit of maximising productivity through using the application.
    * Highlights: This enhancement is an addon to our existing product. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as it required additional classes for it to function the way we wanted.

* **Feature**: Added an extra functionality in `SearchCommand`, that was initially implemented by teammate [Jiqing](https://github.com/judowha), to be able to recognise case-insensitive or incomplete inputs as keywords.
    * Justification:  This feature improves the product significantly as the user can still find his/her desired show even if the user does not know the full name of the show.
    * Highlights: This enhancement is an addon to our existing search feature. The implementation was challenging as it required additional checks in the search algorithm to make sure the enhancement worked.
