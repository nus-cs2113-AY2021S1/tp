# Overview

**WatchNext** is a show tracker designed for users who watch their favourite shows on multiple free streaming platforms and other open source streaming websites.
**WatchNext** also records your progress for the different shows you are currently watching, and even for upcoming shows that you plan to watch.
We have used this project to showcase our ideas and skillset and we believe that even though this is a student project, it has potential to much more.
