## Project: Nav@NUS

Nav@NUS is a useful command line interface (CLI) application to guide you in navigating around the NUS campus
via the school's shuttle services. It is written in Java, and has about 4 kLoC.

## Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **RouteMapCommand**: Displays the full bus route of a selected bus 
  * What it does: Allows users to check for full bus routes of selected buses.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user could use this information to plan
  for indirect bus routes.
  * Highlights: This features form the foundation for future commands to be added in later stages of this application
   e.g. finding indirect bus routes.

* **Search Frequency**: Implemented search frequencies of bus stops to inform users about their most search bus stop.
  * What it does: Allows users to check for most-searched bus route.
  * Justification: This feature personalises the application for users and gives the memory jolt needed to key in their
  commands.
  
* **Delete Fav**: Added the ability to delete favourite commands.
  * What it does: Allows users to delete favourite commands to customise favourite commands list.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to remove commands in the favourite list that are no longer useful to them.
