## Project: Trippie 

Trippie is a command-line desktop application used for planning trips, tracking expenses and converting exchange rates.
It is specifically catered for the needs of student travellers. It allows multiple trip plans and is designed for quick
and efficient inputs.


### Summary of Contributions
Given below are a list of my contribution to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to add new items into the expense list.
    - What it does: It allows user to add new purchases in foreign currency into a list by entering the item name, cost 
    and day it was bought.
    - Justification: This feature sets up the key expense function of our application. It requires the minimal 
    information and allows efficient inclusion of data. When user purchase item during their trip, the cost they look 
    in foreign currency, therefore inputs are in foreign currency as well. 
    
- **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete existing items from the expense list.
    - What it does: It allows user to remove an existing item of their choice from the expense list.
    - Justification: This feature offers users with a guilt-free flexibility when they key in their expenses. In the 
    case of an incorrect input, this feature allows user to erase the input.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to display the existing items in the expense list.
    - What it does: This feature displays user's pre-assigned budget, expense list, total spending, amount remaining 
    and percentage spent.
    - Justification: This feature executes Trippie's main aim to track user's spending and reminds user to keep within 
    their budget. 
    - Highlight: The list of items are sorted by days for easy referencing. This feature displays all amounts in both 
    foreign and local currency. A percentage bar of amount spent offers quick insights for user to gauge their spending.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to convert any amount from local to foreign currency or vice versa.
    - What it does: This feature allows simple on-the-go conversion from either local to foreign or foreign back to 
    local currency.
    - Justification: This feature is especially efficient when travelling as it quickly converts amount inputted using 
    the available exchange rate. It also compliments well with the adding of expenses function if the user is unsure of 
    an item's amount in foreign currency.
