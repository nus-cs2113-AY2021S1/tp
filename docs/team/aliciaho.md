## Project: Plan&Score

Plan&Score is a Java command-line application that allows Primary 6 students to plan and track their classes, CCAs and test dates. This enables the students to remember their schedule, so they can plan well in advance for their tests and score better.

## Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.
* Features:
    * Add test 
    <br>
    What it does: Allow users to add a test to their schedule.
    <br>
    Justification: This feature improves the product because the users can tests to their schedule to better plan for it. Hence, allowing them to revise for their tests well in advance.
    <br>
    * Delete test 
    <br>
    What it does: Allow users to delete a test to their schedule.
    <br>
    Justification: This feature improves the product because the users can delete any past tests or tests that have been cancelled. 
    Hence, allowing them to better plan their schedule. 
    <br>
    * Set Recommended hours
    <br>
    What it does: Allow users to set their recommended hours per day.
    <br>
    Justification: This feature improves the product because the users are able to set the amount of productive hours they want to accomplish.
    This allows users to remain within their recommended hours thus preventing them from overloading.
    <br>
    Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future e.g checking if time exceeded.
    The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and classes.
    <br>
    * List event today/[date]
    <br>
    What it does: Allow users to list their events for today or the date they desire.
    <br>
    Justification: This feature improves the product because users are able to check the schedule for that day.
    <br>
    * Time left
    <br>
    What it does: Allow users to see the amount of productive hours they have for a particular day.
    <br>
    Justification: This feature improves the product because users are able to know how 
    many productive hours they have left for that day thus, they are able to better plan their schedule and not overload.
    <br>
    Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands e.g add/delete/list event.
    The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and classes.
    <br>
    * Date Time conversion
    <br>
    What it does: Converts date time from yyyy-MM-dd HHmm to date time in natural language format.
    <br>
    Justification: This feature improves the product because users can intuitively know the date time of their events.
    <br>
    Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands e.g add/delete.
    The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and classes.
