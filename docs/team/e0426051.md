# Zhao Haoxiang - Project Portfolio Page for SCRUMptious

## Overview
My team of 4 software engineering students and I have created a command line interface project managing software for our CS2113T team project. The app, called SCRUMptious, aims to help project managers handle their project teams efficiently with the help of the SCRUM methodology and digital technologies.
