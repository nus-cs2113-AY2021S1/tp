# Zhao Haoxiang - Project Portfolio Page for SCRUMptious

## Overview
My team consisting of 5 software engineering students created a command line interface(CLI) project management
software for our CS2113T team project. The application, SCRUMptious, aims to help project managers manage 
their project teams effectively by an implementation of the SCRUM methodology.
