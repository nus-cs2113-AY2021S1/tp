# Ho Ming Jun - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
My team of 4 software engineering students and I created a command line interface project managing 
software for our CS2113T team project. The app, called SCRUMptious, aims to help project managers handle 
their project teams efficiently with the help of the SCRUM methodology and digital technologies.

### Summary of Contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

**Functionalities added**: `ParserManager`, `Command` and several subparsers and subcommand classes.

I created a `ParserManager` and `Command` class with several subclasses for SCRUMptious to handle the user input.  
The `ParserManager` mainly parses the user input and checks to see what kind of `Command` has been 
given by the user. Subsequently, once the `Command` has been identified, the `ParserManager` then passes on the parameters to
the respective subparsers to validate the parameters. If the validation is unsuccessful, an error message with the corresponding details 
will be printed out for the user to see. If validation is successful, the subparser will then call the respective `Command` subclasses 
before returning the respective `Command` to the `ParserManager`. After which, the `ParserManager` will return the command to the 
main `Scrumptious` class for execution of the command.
