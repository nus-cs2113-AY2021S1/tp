## Project: Zer0Note

Zer0Note is a note taking and organisation application meant for students(especially those who can type fast). It combines the features of note-taking apps (like OneNote) with the interaction speed of command-line based tools like vim and emacs. It helps students (like yourself!) to keep track of deadlines and take notes quickly.

### Summary of Contributions
- Created ASCII art for Zer0Note
- New Feature: Added the ability to add tasks and notebooks/sections/pages
  - What it does: It allows the user to add tasks in Timetable mode and add notebooks/sections/pages in Notebook mode.
  - Justification: This feature is essential for the purpose of our application, which is to keep track of deadlines and organise notes.
  - Highlights: Since it is the building block for other the features, it required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
- New Feature: Added the ability to select a notebook/section/page
  - Justification: This feature makes Notebook mode more interactive for the user. It allows the user to navigate between notebooks, sections and pages, just like he would if he had many physical notebooks.
