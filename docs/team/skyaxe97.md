implementation of most methods that were eventually needed for the other functionalities. 
1. The AddDeadline/Event/Lesson command. This command allows users to add their Task to the TaskList.
1. The DeleteTask command. I implemented the functionality to allow users to delete any added Tasks. 
I also implemented the functionality that allows the program to prompt the User for a step-by-step procedure for deleting Tasks.
1. The EditDeadline/Event/Lesson command. I implemented the functionality to allow users to edit any added Tasks.
I also implemented the functionality that allows the program to prompt the User for a step-by-step procedure for editing Tasks.
