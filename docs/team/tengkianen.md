## Project: Trippie 

Trippie is a command-line interface desktop application used for planning trips, tracking expenses and converting exchange rates.
It is specifically catered for the needs of student travellers. It allows multiple trip plans and is designed for quick
and efficient inputs. It also saves your changes automatically when you exit the application.


### Summary of Contributions
Given below are a list of my contribution to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to list places in the place list.
    - What it does: It allows user to see all places/events that has been added into the place list in a sorted manner.
     User can choose to view all places/events or user can filter by the places in a specific day.
    - Justification: This feature sets up the key list function of our application. 
    - Highlight: Even if the user enters the places/events in a disorderly manner, this function still sorts the places 
    according to day and time for user to view it in an organized manner.
    
- **New Feature**: Added the ability to search a keyword in the place list.
    - What it does: It allows user to use a keyword to search through the place list and returns the matches.
    - Justification: This feature offers users a quick way to find certain places/events that they have already added.
     This allows the user to confirm specific places he/she had planned and refer to them easily.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to create a new trip entirely.
    - What it does: This feature allows user to easily create a new trip and prompts the user to enter key information 
    regarding the new trip (e.g. name of trip and start date of trip).
    - Justification: This feature is extremely easy to understand as unlike the other functions in the application, it 
    successively prompts the user to enter key information of the trip itself. Hence, there is no need to remember to 
    a whole list of commands in this case. It is done for this commmand as there are a lot of information to be parsed
    at this stage.
