# Rani Karthigeyan Rajendrakumar - Project Portfolio Page for traKCAL

## Overview
**traKCAL** is a desktop application for managing calorie intake, optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI) whilst retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). **traKCAL** can manage your activities faster than traditional GUI applications.

#### Enhancements implemented

*A summary of the enhancements you implemented.*

* I added the commandParser enhancement which filters the userinput to their respective command classes.
* I added the delete features (delete by index and delete all). Delete by index allows users to delete an activity by referring 
to the respective index in the list. Delete All is an enhancement on top of delete by index which allows users to delete all the activities in the list. 
> Commands:
> delete **index**
> delete all/

* I added the graph command which displays the graph of upto 7 days worth of net calories. The graph also has a target calorie line, 
so that users will be able to know if their goals are met.
> Commands:
> graph
