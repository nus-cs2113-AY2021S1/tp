## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Project Overview 
DOMNUS - is a desktop application that helps in module and task tracking. It was developed under the module CS2113 Software Engineering & Object Oriented Programming. Within the schedule of approximately 7 weeks, my team of 5 Computer Engineering students successfully created DOMNUS to help students to stay organize with respective to the modules they take in NUS. 

## 2. Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project. 
- Co-SubTeam Lead: Responsible for daily task functionality enhancements project coordination alongside Kwek Chu Han. 
- GitHub Expert: Responsible for setting up, monitoring GitHub workflow, and solving GitHub-related issues.
- Integrating, Scheduling, and Tracking: In charge of assigning and tracking daily task enhancements task. Worked with Kwek Chu Han for implementing additional features.
- In charge of `focus`, `reminder`, `snooze`, `postpone` of the code. 

### 2.1 Enhancements Implemented: 
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

New Feature: `Postpone [index] or [h/w/y] [index]`
<br> 
What it does: Typing `postpone [index] or [h /w /y] [index]` delays a task specified by the user or by default a day with option `h` for an hour,`w` for a week, or `y` for a year.
<br>
Justification: To postpone a deadline or event task directly if the user schedule changes at any time.
<br>
Highlights: This commands can be enhanced in the future for intelligent postpone functionality that could also handle custom date and/or time such as Mon, and/or 9 pm.
<br>


New Feature: `Snooze`
<br>
What it does: Typing `snooze` delays reminder popup by a default of 1 minute.
<br>
Justification: reminder popup can sometimes be disturbing to the user so by typing snooze, the popup will have a longer delay. Hence, the user can type without disturbance.
<br>
Highlights: This enhancement affects the automatic reminder functionality.
<br>


New Feature: `Reminder`
<br>
What it does: Typing `reminder` prints the tasks that are due within a certain time range or to activate the reminder.
<br>
Justification: since the reminder popup scheduler sometimes can be too long for the user. The user can easily call the reminder popup by typing reminder.
<br>
Highlights: The reminder popup may affect the whole user experience. However, this particular feature will only be executed when typing `reminder` 
<br>


New Feature: `Focus` (Created the first version)
<br>
What it does: changes the context that all other commands are based on the specified target. 
<br>
Justification: The user should also be able to change context so that the user can only focus on single task type list.
<br>
Highlights: The first implementation of this command affected existing commands drastically. The updated version is currently present and working.
