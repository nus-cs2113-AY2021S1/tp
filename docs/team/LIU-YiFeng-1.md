## Overview
Our product, **_25HoursADay_** is a scheduling application catered for NUS students. 
It is optimised for use via the Command Line Interface (CLI) and it serves as an efficient one stop application for our users to manage their time. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Enhancements implemented:
#### Enhancements to New features:
* Added ability to print all tasks and all events separately.
 ([\#10](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/10))
  * What it does: It allows the user to have an easy overview of all the events and tasks stored in the program.
  * Justification: It allows the user to retrieve the index number for a particular event or task. So that the user can 
                    perform other operations (such as deletion, mark as done, adding additional information and viewing additional information etc) easily.
  * Highlights: It displays all events and tasks with additional information if there is any.
  
 * Integrated a third party library (fastjson) to the project and added the ability to verify the module code entered by the user.
  ([\#126](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/126),
  [\#246](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/246),
  [\#270](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-2/tp/pull/270),
  )
   * What it does: It checks the validity of the module code entered by the user against the NUSMod API.
   If valid, program will proceed as per normal. Else, it will prompt the user with an error message.
   * Justification: As a task scheduling application, it is crucial for the applicaiton to provide some sanity check to ensure the 
   user has entered the correct information, so as to present the user with accurate information.
   * Highlights: This feature is functional with or without the Internet.
  
#### Enhancement to existing features:
* Shorten and Standardised the user command input format to make the code more readable.
