## Overview

**revisED** is a CLI application to help students revise by allowing them to create flashcards, take quizzes, 
and keep track of their deadlines, tasks and any other important dates. It is written in Java.

## Summary of Contributions

* **Code contributed:** [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=cookiehoodie&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-09-27&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other) 
* **Features implemented:** 
    * Storing of data in the form of nested folders and files for easier navigation and manual changes by the users. 
        * This was challenging because a lot of testings needed to be done to make sure the hierarchy was created as intended, 
        as compared to storing all data to one place.
        * Credit: the methods for storing and loading tasks are taken from [JiaLerk](https://github.com/jialerk), though with 
        quite some modifications to improve on them. (Pull requests: [#83](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W13-1/tp/pull/83))
    * Loading of the saved data
        * loading the data stored in this way posed challenges because the user can make a lot more variation of changes
        to the stored data, as compared to storing all data in one file. Thus, a lot of exception handling needed to be done
        to make sure the application still works with corrupted data.
    * Exporting of all data to one Json file for the use of other applications.
* **Enhancements implemented:** 
    * Enhanced the code to reduce redundancy and improve design.
