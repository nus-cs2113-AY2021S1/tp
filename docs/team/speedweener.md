## Overview

Our team of 5 Computer Engineering students created the Java Commmand Line Interface app Zoomaster. In times
where most lessons are held online over Zoom, Zoomaster allows students to conveniently save all their important
bookmarks and launch them when needed. Zoomaster also has a timetable feature, which allows students to recreate
their lesson timetable and add bookmarks to each individual lesson slot. The app can then launch the specific
links required by matching the system time with the timetable. Lastly, the app also has a meeting planner feature, which
can help groups of students swiftly determine available meeting times by comparing their timetable slots.

#### Enhancements implemented:  
* The JAnsi library to allow coloured output on the Command Line, so that the output to the user is more vibrant
and the differentiation between types of messages is clearer (eg. Error messages are red in colour). Also enables
the clear screen function. Also created the Zoomaster logo (including the one in the code).
* Retrieving of NUS module list from NUS MODS API based on the current year. Allows for validation of modules entered,
prevents errors due to typos for modules.
* Obtaining the jar file path for saving data of the app, such that the app can be run from anywhere in the command line
with the save files still being read from and saved in the same folder as the jar file. This allows running of the 
application to be much more convenient.
* Extended HelpCommand, so that users can quickly check the format for different command in each different mode without
having to check back with the User Guide.

#### Contributions to the UG:  
* Did some initial set up for User Guide. Also contributed to:
    * Quick Start 
    * Clear Screen
    * Show, Add, Delete, Find, Launch (bookmark mode)
    * FAQ

#### Contributions to the DG:  
* Did diagram for the overall architecture, initialization class diagram, Commands class diagrams.
* Explained Ui component
* Did sequence diagrams and explanations for Validate Modules feature and Extended HelpCommand feature
