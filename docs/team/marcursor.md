## Project: Scheduler--;

Scheduler--; (S--) is a desktop daily planner application for managing day-to-day events. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI). It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to this project.

### Summary of Contributions

- Feature: Implemented the ability to check for events occurring within a given time period.
    - What it does: Allows the user to provide a start date, start time, end date and end time to specify a time period to check for events.
    - Justification: This feature is useful because it enables users to easily check their availability during a given period.
    - Highlights: This feature allows for various input formats for date and time, including partially filled out dates/times. This required analysis on how to process date and time inputs to return a valid date/time value.
    
- Feature: Implemented the mark events as done/undone.
    - What it does: Allows the user to set the status of events to done/undone.
    - Justification: This feature is important as it allows users to keep track of the status of their events.
    - Highlights: This feature needs to look for matching events in sub ArrayLists in the case of repeated events. This involves interpreting of the events during execution. 
    
- Feature: Implemented the ability to delete events from Scheduler--;.
    - What it does: Allows the user to delete events from Scheduler--;.
    - Justification: This feature is important as it allows users to have more control over their events schedule. The feature allows for removal of obsolete or erroneously input events.
    - Highlights:
