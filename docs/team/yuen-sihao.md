# Yuen Si Hao - Project Portfolio Page for Quotesify

## Overview
I am part of a team of 5 software engineering students and we were tasked to design and implement a
Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application for our team project. The application that we developed
is called Quotesify. I was tasked with the Rating System for Books feature in Quotesify.

### About the project
Quotesify is a free desktop application to help book readers improve their reading experience. With Quotesify,
users can add books and quotes they wished to remember into the application. Users can also categorize their books and
quotes, as well as rate their books. Quotesify is also built with a progress tracker to manage your reading activities.

## Summary of Contributions
This section shows a brief summary of my contributions to the team project, including coding, documenting
and other helpful contributions throughout the development of Quotesify.

### Enhancements implemented:
I added the Rating System for books feature in Quotesify.

**What it does:**
* The user will be able to use `add -r` command to add rating to a book that exists in Quotesify.
* The user may use `edit -r` or `delete -r` commands to edit and delete their existing ratings respectively.
* The user can use `list -r` to list all their existing ratings or to list books of a specific rating value.
* The user may also use `find -r` to find ratings of books with title that contains the specified keyword.

**Justification:**
This feature is designed to allow users to rate the books that they have read, as a record of how they feel
about the book. This will help users to be able to recommend books to their friends and fellow book readers easily.

**Highlights:**
The ratings are sorted according to their rating score when listed, with the highest rating at the top.
This is to reduce the amount users need to scroll as they would often want to view the ratings of books
that they like, rather than those with lower ratings.

### Contributions to documentation:
* I contributed to the parts of the UG that describe and explain the Rating System for books feature.
* I also contributed to other sections of the UG such as Introduction, Getting Help in Quotesify,
Terminating the program, and the Command Summary.

### Contributions to the DG:
* I contributed to the parts of the DG that describe and explain the Rating System for books feature,
including the UML diagrams.
* I also contributed to other sections of the DG such as Introduction, Setting up, Product Scope,
User Stories, and Non-Functional Requirements.

### Contributions to team-based tasks:
* Project Management: Maintaining the issue tracker by managing the various milestones and their deadlines.
* General formatting of UG/DG as a team.

### Contributions beyond the project team:
* I reported bugs and offered suggestions for other teams to consider during the DG review and PE tests.
