## Overview
_ModTracker_ is a desktop app for NUS students to track the time spent 
as well as tasks to do for each of their modules.
It helps students to prioritise their work and 
balance their time spent amongst their modules. 
This app uses a Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Summary of Contributions
This section gives a description of the different contributions I have made in this project.

### Code Contributed

### Enhancements Implemented
The main feature which I worked on for this project was the storage feature,
which stores data inputted by the user to an external file. 
At the start of the program, it will also load the data from this file.

The data consists of the user's name, as well as the modules and tasks data.

Other enhancements I have made include:
* Feature to clear all modules and tasks data
* Feature to reset all data and restart the program
* Improving security by setting the external file to read-only when not in use

### Contributions to User Guide
I added the explanations for my features, which are 
* Save user data (Section 2.17)
* Clear module and task data (Section 2.18)
* Delete user data (Section 2.19)

Besides, I edited the introduction, and the expanded on the 
explanations for other features in response to feedback from our 
CS2101 tutor. 
I also made minor changes to ensure that the overall format is consistent. 

### Contributions to the Developer Guide
I was in charge of writing the Parser and Storage components under
the Design section of the Developer Guide. For implementation, I wrote 
about the storage feature (Section 4.1). I also edited the contents
to phrase the sentences in a more active rather than passive form, 
and checked that there were no major errors such as missing hyperlinks. 

### Contributions to Team-based Tasks
Some team-based tasks I did include reviewing and refactoring
 my teammate's code, releasing a new version on GitHub, finding bugs
 in the program, keeping track of our deadlines 
 and updating parts of the documentation which are not under mine.

### Contributions Beyond the Project Team
I have helped to review the code and documentation of other teams, 
while providing suggestions to them. I have also tested the jar files
of other teams and reported bugs.
