**Overview**

NotUS is a quick and simple, Command Line Interface (CLI) based, note-taking application for keyboard-inclined users. NotUS allows for users to categorize notes by tagging as well as pinning the more important notes. NotUS is also designed to assist in planning timetables to highlight possible clashes.

- Co-team lead: Responsible for overall project coordination alongside Jun Xiang.
- Documentation and Code Quality: Responsible for the quality of various project documents and ensures adherence to coding standards.
- Integration, Scheduling and Tracking: In charge of assigning, and tracking project tasks. Worked with Jun Xiang for the versioning of the code, maintaining the code repository, integrating various parts of the software.
- In charge of `list-n`,`archive-n`, `unarchive-n`, `find-n`, of the code.

**Summary of Contributions**

*Features implemented*

1\. Completed the following features and test code for them:
`archive-n`: Allows the user to archive a note so their notebook is more organized and less cluttered, to access pertinent notes quicker. `find-n`: Allows the user to find a note by the note title, and retrieve them as opposed to scanning for them in the list, making the process efficient. `help`: Allows the user a quick access on commands available  as the user might not recall all of the commands. `list-n`: Allows the user to see all available notes. Users can sort the notes in ascending/descending order for convenience, or list by tags, or view all archived notes. `unarchive-n`: Allows the user to unarchive a note if the user wants to make changes to the note.

2\. In the `Notebook` class, created: `archivedNotes`, `unarchivedNotes`, `getArchivedNotes`, `getNote`, `checkPinned`, `getSortedList`, `getPinnedNotes`, `getUnpinnedNotes`, `findNotes`. In the `Note` class, created: `toggleArchived`, `getIsArchived`, `getPinned`. Added a couple of `formatNotes` methods into the `Formatter` class.

*Enhancements to existing features*

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Added ASCII art (PR [#90](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/90) and [#80](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/80)). Refactored code to abstract out the (un)successful execution messages (PR [#143](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T13-1/tp/pull/143)) to its own `CommandMessage` class.

*Code contributed*: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=r-ramana&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-09-27&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other) to view a report of the code contribution.

*Contributions to Team Based Task*
