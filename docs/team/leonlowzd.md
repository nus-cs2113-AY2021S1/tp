##### Main Functions Implemented
I am mainly responsible for the data package of SmartHomeBot. Which consists of: 

1. ApplianceList: Data Structure storing the Appliances.
2. LocationList: List of stored locations. 
3. Types of Appliances:    
    1. Air-Conditioner 
    2. Fan 
    3. Lights
    4. Smart Plug 
    
The functionalities and manipulation of data are under my responsibilities, I will have to seek feedbacks from my fellow
teammates for bugs and functionalities requests. 

#### Enhancements implemented
I implemented the ON/OFF by parameters function for SmartHomeBot which enabled the program to change temperature and speed
for Air-Conditioner and Fan type appliances. 

#### Contributions to the DeveloperGuide: 
Provided Class Diagrams for the data package and Sequence Diagrams ON/OFF Commands.
