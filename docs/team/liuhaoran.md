## Overview
DietBook is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application designed mainly _NUS students staying on campus_. It helps users **track their food and nutritional intake** as well as provide them with their **daily calorie recommendation**.
It also supports a **database** containing a list of common food can be found in the restaurants within campus. Users can add foods in the database into the list of consumed food items conveniently. The language used is mainly Java.
