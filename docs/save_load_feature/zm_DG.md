The Save/Load feature is implemented by the saveload package.
At the base of the package, there is the <mark> Saver </mark> 
and <mark> Loader </mark>  class.

### Architecture
![Alt text](Architecture.png)
Note only the Saver and Loader class is flexible. They can be adapted to new situations without modifying
the code. The FoodSaveLoadManager and PersonSaveLoadManager are written specifically for this version. They
will have to be modified/replaced for future versions.

#### Saver class

Stores data in a internal table with length and height specified.
Handles the storage of its data by writing to a text file.

the user only has to specify the file name.

* FoodSaveLoadManager#load() loads the file and returns the list of food objects stored inside it

#### PersonSaveLoadManager class
